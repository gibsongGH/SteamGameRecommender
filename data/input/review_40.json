No story here so we're jumping straight into graphics. \n\nGraphics:\n\nSince this is running of the same engine as the first Half Life game, it's no surprise that this game is dated in the art department. There's nothing really that special about it and most textures (apart from guns) seemed to be ripped out from Half Life. \n\nAudio:\n\nThe audio design is decent, but overall nothing special. The guns sound meaty and the explosions have the same nice sound like in Half Life, albeit a little distorted. Overall nothing too note worthy. \n\nGameplay:\n\nDeathmatch Classic is Valve's throwback to Id Software's arena shooters like Quake. It's honestly a decent game, but sadly like most other Valve classic multiplayer games, it's absolutely dead. Unlike most of their other games I managed to play a match, but this was on a server that had insane ping, making it basically unplayable. \n\nMy shots would go straight through people, so I couldn't kill anyone and after sometime I just quit out. Other servers were completely empty and I couldn't get any matches going. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThis one seems like a decent game, but sadly it's completely dead so I cannot recommend this one, when games like Quake still have players kicking around in their servers. So skip this one. \n\nFinal Rating:\n5/10\n\nPros:\n+ Gameplay is fun \n+ Guns have meaty sounds\n\nCons:\n- Game is completely dead and some servers have too high of a ping\n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews", "timestamp_created": 1586298057, "timestamp_updated": 1586298057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608210563659667969", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "66724711": {"recommendationid": "66724711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097652737", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 153, "last_played": 1587489575}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game for a nice deathmatch with the only rule being K I L L", "timestamp_created": 1586149611, "timestamp_updated": 1586149611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "66557824": {"recommendationid": "66557824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046450713", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 121, "last_played": 1585975425}, "language": "english", "review": "This is just a pvp version of of Half Life 1 combat.

base of around 16 people remaining, and a max ccu of 8, Deathmatch Classic will continue to slowly gasp for life until the last diehards move on entirely.\n\nThe game boasts of a terrible camera system, and servers which work only rarely, trying to login to the game saw my gaming rig CTD about 16 times, with laggy and at times non-responsive -servers to lock up the launcher, all that's left for Deathmatch Classic is to let go finally, and pass on the throw rug and china tea set to the grandkids.\n\nWhile Deathmatch Classic was a semi-important part of gaming history, it's not the powerhouse Quake, and Doom was, and rightly deserves to quietly slip away into its eternal slumber.\n\nhttps://bluntlyhonestreviews.com/2019/11/11/deathmatch-classic-houston-we-have-a-problem/",

I think this game might be a bit more familiar to some of you old school shooter fans if I ask this question: have you played QuakeWorld? If so, well, this is basically QuakeWorld on GoldSrc. Not that that's a bad thing inherently, GoldSrc fits a game like Quake quite OK, actually. The problem with DMC is, the movement sucks. It's a lot worse than even something like NetQuake. I'm not sure how to explain it further, but I suppose gameplay videos would help prove my point (or not, it's still quite a bit subjective).\n\nThe maps are mostly just carbon copies of stock Quake DM maps with lambdas, with the exception of dm1 & dm5 for whatever reason. There's this one other map in the default rotation, which is dmc_e1m2 (EDIT 10/1/2019: this may be because the famous Red Annihilation was performed on this map). Once again, a Quake map, but with some deathmatch-appropriate changes like removing traps & monsters.\n\nThe weapons, well, for the most part, they're just retextures. The sounds are like what you'd hear from such weapons in Half-Life (this is most recognizable with shotguns). The crowbar has the same sound as Ranger's axe in Quake, funnily enough, but that doesn't matter, nobody uses that anyway. Not in Quake, & not in DMC. If you know your Quake loadout, simply get used to the weapon models & you'll feel right at home, especially since the weapons are still at the center of your screen (yay!). Besides maybe the thunderbolt, that thing makes your screen shake awkwardly (still does the same thing, though).\n\nThe community...is actually OK! I hosted a server for this game (mainly as a test), got a friend & me into it in the evening (Eastern time) & to my surprise, we managed to get 5 concurrent players! Now, on dmc_dm4 (the DMC version of the infamous Quake map), this would be quite hectic (note: this is an FFA, not TDM). However, on some maps you might find yourself actually...quite in need of more action than you can get with 5 players on that map. Probably the best example of that is dm3, which has historically been a TDM map in the QuakeWorld scene, but is still great fun for FFA if you have like...maybe 8 players? Quite an achivement for a DMC server, but nonetheless common.\n\nThat part was about the community's livelihood, mostly, but how is the community as far as stuff like toxicity / average skill goes? Glad you asked, as this may be...one of the only reasons one may want to play this game. The average skill of the DMC player is \"not an FPS casual but never really played QuakeWorld\", which I find rather inviting compared to the QuakeWorld scene where people have the bhops & the rocket jumps & they have the whole map layouts memorized & all, wew! Sadly that's an inherent flaw of almost any high skill cap game without ranked matchmaking. If this is your first time playing DMC & someone joins the server...well, chances are they're also playing this game for the first time. It's not like in QuakeWorld or AG (a competitive HLDM mod) where you'll likely see some kid who will frag you every single time for 10m straight. It's very much a casual shooter due to the amount of involvement people have with it. Things like Quake have always been very competitive from the start, with people finding practically every single way to exploit the engine to their advantage (not in a derogatory sense, not at all, I respect it) & practically mastering it. It's like a speedrun scene. It's definitely rather intimidating if you're not willing to do the same, I'll be straight up on that. The toxicity of the QuakeWorld community is practically identical to that of the DMC community: very minimal, if even real (I have yet to see any myself). Use of chat can be commonly seen (but not with most players, maybe 1 in 4 players), & it's often actual English & not a \":^)\" bind.\n\nNow, the engine. Back in its heyday I can really see why one'd prefer GoldSrc over the Quake engine. Even today I still find some aspects of the GoldSrc engine fun, like the ridiculous over-the-top skeletal animation (jumping animations, especially, wew). But guess what, Quake's source code has been around since roughly Y2K. There are loads of source ports (forks), & I'd say a lot of the more famous ones ones like FTEQW or ezQuake / nQuake are equally good-looking, if not even better than GoldSrc. This is especially true in the case of FTEQW, which I'd say could go beyond Quake 3 Arena levels of graphics if Quake used anything besides brown. Trying to argue in favor of GoldSrc without introducing some kind of nostalgia factor really doesn't get places, & I really don't want to be talking purely on the basis of nostalgia here.\n\nOne area where you could certainly argue in favor of DMC, however, is ease of setup, albeit only just a bit.\n\nDMC's setup process:\n1. click INSTALL\n2. click PLAY\n3. profit (???)\n\nezQuake setup process:\n1. install Quake from Steam / GOG\n2. throw ezQuake somewhere\n3. drop pak0.pak & pak1.pak from the Quake Steam / GOG files into id1 in ezQuake's directory\n4. launch it\n5. basically done\n\nIt's...really not a major difference. Even if you just wanna play it casually, this can be done in literal seconds, assuming your internet connection is good.\n\nNow, with all that info out of the way, would I say the game is worth it? Not really. However, should you refrain from playing it? Nah. Even I, who is mostly into QuakeWorld for the fast action & extremely responsive movement, will admit there is no be-all end-all reason to avoid DMC. It's an OK way to spend a Sunday evening if there's a server with players. I wouldn't recommend that this be your daily driver, though. It's extremely unlikely you'll get many hours out of this game & you're much better off buying Quake for that if you're willing to get gud. Quake has a lot more to offer as well, such as a match readying / warmup system on almost all servers, TDM, CTF, & also QWTF (the very first Team Fortress).\n\nI am aware I'm not too good at organizing & not too many will ask this, but since I felt I had to put it somewhere:\n\n[quote=Whoever] Uh, why do you compare it to QuakeWorld so much? [/quote]\n\nWell, that's because DMC basically is Quake, even intentionally. It's right there in the description: \"...tribute to the work of id software...\" & this \"work\" is almost certainly Quake. It's certainly not DOOM or Wolfenstein, is it? The maps are basically the same, the loadout is basically the same, & even the objective. They even kept the lack of crouching like in Quake, contrary to every other GoldSrc game out there. I'm not sure if anyone could want more proof that DMC is a Quake clone.\n\nAnd, that is all.

Go into settings and turn on Raw Mouse Input in settings to fix the glitchy mouse. When it goes on sale gift this game to your friends which makes the game much more fun. Equip the grappling hook on certain servers by typing \u201cbind MOUSE2 +hook\u201d in Console (without the quotation marks of course). \n\n\nI've written and changed my review for Deathmatch Classic many times, but that is because the more I play it the more I like it. It is an extremely simple game with 3 objectives:\n  1. Shoot gun at anything that moves\n  2. Pick up shiny power-ups\n  3. Don't die\n\nYou may not think that FPS games can be relaxing, but I find that this game actually is. After playing some intense rounds of Counter-Strike or Team Fortress, it feels nice to forget about\nall of those map objectives or teammates and to simply click mouse 1 and aim. \n\nTHE WEAPONS \n\n7 out of 8 weapons in Deathmatch Classic (which can be abbreviated to DMC) are from Quake, with the other one being the crowbar from Half-Life. The default weapons you get when you spawn is the crowbar and single barrel shotgun. As you run around the map, you pick up weapons. When somebody picks up the rocket launcher or lightning gun, that\u2019s basically all you use until you die or run out ammo because they are INSANELY powerful. You really won\u2019t ever use the crowbar. You use the 1 through 8 keys to switch the weapons, and the order is Crowbar, Single Barrel Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Nailgun, Super Nailgun, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, and Lightning Gun. It is important to note that these are for the most part the game organizes it by worst to best. You can pick up ammo across the map, and when a player dies they will drop a brown backpack with whatever weapons and ammo they had. \n\nTHE ARMOR AND POWER-UPS\n\nSince Deathmatch Classic is heavily based off of Quake, it also has the Green, Yellow and Red Armor. The best armor is the red armor, which gives you 200 armor points and 80% damage protection. Since it is the best armor in the game, it is also the rarest. Maps usually put this armor in a hard to reach area. The next best armor is the yellow armor, which gives you 150 armor points and 60% damage protection. The basic and easiest to find armor is the green armor which gives you 100 armor points and 60% damage protection. This armor will most likely be very easy to get. There are also 3 power-ups in Deathmatch Classic, the Quad Damage, Ring of Shadows and the Protection. The Quad Damage is a very strong powerup that can be a blessing or a curse. The Quad Damage gives you the opportunity to wipe out a whole server, but keep in mind that if you have a rocket launcher and you shoot someone very close to you, you will most likely kill yourself too because of the increased damage from the explosion. Keep in mind that the Quad Damage does not offer any sort of damage protection and you will not be able to survive any more damage than you normally would without the power-up. The next power-up is the Ring of Shadows. It allows you to become almost invisible, but players will still be able to see a sort of shiny effect from you when they are close. In my opinion, this is definitely the worst power-up because 90% of the time you are shooting others up close. The last and probably best power-up is the Protection power-up. It allows you to be invincible to all attacks. If you see someone with this powerup, run. Even if they are running at you with a crowbar, you can\u2019t do anything to stop them. \n\nTHE MAPS \n\nDeathmatch Classic was originally released with 5 maps from Quake levels such as e1m2 (The Castle of the Damned) as dmc_e1m2. Over the years, more Quake maps were added into Deathmatch Classic by the community. One map I love is dmc_dapro1, a community map. In addition, many of the Quake Deathmatch levels such as dm2 (Claustrophobopolis) are in the game. Some servers have grappling hooks which adds a lot more fun to the game, but also sort of ruins the challenge of getting to hard to reach areas. \n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\n\nDeathmatch Classic gameplay is quite similar to Quake, but a lot slower. This is nice because it is now easier to aim, but also takes out some of the action. You can also use all of the same movement styles (Bhopping, Rocket Jumping) that are in Quake in Deathmatch Classic. The gameplay also suffers quite a bit because most of the time you will be playing against bots and not real people. Obviously the bots aren\u2019t as intelligent as real players but you still do get some high points. For example, nothing feels better than finding a backpack with a rocket launcher with full ammo, and soon after finding the red armor and going on a huge killing spree. \n\nTHE PROBLEM\n\n\nDeathmatch Classic is practically dead. There is no other way of putting it. When I start up the game, usually nobody else is on. I\u2019ve never seen a full Deathmatch Classic server that didn\u2019t have bots. Rarely the game will get a revival like this one     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydq8s6hvGeg. However, there aren't any plans for another event like that as far as I know. Also, the video gives you a good idea on what the gameplay is like. Another problem that people experience when actually joining a server is the mouse sort of glitching out. \n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nThere are a couple of alternatives to Deathmatch Classic such as ezQuake, and OpenArena. ezQuake was created so that it would be a lot easier to download and play QuakeWorld. QuakeWorld is basically just multiplayer Quake. OpenArena is a Quake III Arena clone which lets you experience the Quake game but for free. Neither of these games have tons of people playing on them, but they do have more people and more servers. \n\n   Download ezQuake Here: https://ezquake.github.io/\n   Download OpenArena here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/oarena/\n\nThe solution to the glitchy mouse is by opening Deathmatch Classic, clicking the Options button, clicking the Mouse button and then checking the Raw Mouse Input box, which is the last box on the Mouse options. When I had a problem with the mouse snapping around doing that in the options fixed it for me. \n\nTHE HISTORY\n\nThe Goldsrc Engine which Half-Life 1, Counter Strike 1.6, Counter Strike: Condition Zero, Ricochet, Team Fortress Classic, Day of Defeat and finally Deathmatch Classic actually came from the Quake engine. However, Valve completely modified it to do what they needed. As a tribute to id Software, they created Deathmatch Classic. It was released on June 7, 2001 for retail and took about 3 months to develop. Deathmatch Classic was never really popular and before the 2018 revival the highest player count was 78 on December 5, 2005 according to https://steamdb.info/app/40/graphs/. It was originally free with Half-Life but obviously now it costs 5 dollars on Steam. A Source Engine port (called Deathmatch Classic: Source) was being worked on in 2004, but was scrapped. In 2009 the project was picked up again, but was also abandoned for the most part. \n\nTHE CONCLUSION \n\nDeathmatch Classic is great, but unfortunately is past what little prime it had. It still is an absolute blast to play, but other free alternatives also offer great moments like that for free. Buy this game for your friends to make it infinitely more fun than it already is. Recommended, but check out the alternatives too.", "timestamp_created": 1555600369, "timestamp_updated": 1592232343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49797164": {"recommendationid": "49797164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211527372", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1552433404}, "language": "english", "review": "Shame no one plays it", "timestamp_created": 1553730929, "timestamp_updated": 1553730929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582941949367523193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49790426": {"recommendationid": "49790426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011426388", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "its kinda like roblox", "timestamp_created": 1553702057, "timestamp_updated": 1553702057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455642998218536377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49617089": {"recommendationid": "49617089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797314503", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 112, "last_played": 1581818374}, "language": "english", "review": "jdjdjdjdjjdjjddjdwjjsafnjnjsajsajkakjAUQQIUQ", "timestamp_created": 1552841241, "timestamp_updated": 1552841241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475352108478546143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49511441": {"recommendationid": "49511441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056736641", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 346, "last_played": 1552363539}, "language": "english", "review": "boy oh boy do i love minecraft", "timestamp_created": 1552366412, "timestamp_updated": 1552366412, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.343225628137588501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48937657": {"recommendationid": "48937657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250913800", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 379, "last_played": 1593367079}, "language": "english", "review": "I like cheeseburgers, oh and this game is pretty good too.", "timestamp_created": 1549928856, "timestamp_updated": 1556128323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48786182": {"recommendationid": "48786182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264585443", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 47, "last_played": 1549405178}, "language": "english", "review": "Totally one of da best classics, pitty is dead but at least I found one server....with bots dayum", "timestamp_created": 1549407257, "timestamp_updated": 1549407257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48764254": {"recommendationid": "48764254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124383459", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1549328560}, "language": "english", "review": "It's essentially Quake Deathmatch on Goldsrc with some elements from Half Life.

What else can you say to describe this \u221e+1000000/10 masterpeice of a game. No other game IN THE WORLD compares to the perfection that is this game. In fact, no, it's not a game, it's an experience. Calling it a \"game\" is an insult to Deathmatch Classic as it's like comparing it to lesser titles. There just can't be a deathmatch 2 because Valve knows it'll never be as good as the first Deathmatch in a million LIFETIMES and that it would be spitting in Deathmatch classic's face. If you've never heard of Deathmatch Classic or even have the audacity to think this masterpiece is bad, then you might as well be blind or deaf or both, because Deathmatch Classic isn't just a lesser known Valve game, it was a literal gift from the gods that was rediscovered in the blessed year of 2000. It was found in an underground temple in Death Valley, California. They found hieroglyphics showing that before the settlers came to America, an unknown tribe of Indians praised Deathmatch Classic as a god, but looking deeper into the temple also showed that Deathmatch Classic is a divine being who has existed before creation itself! And in an unknown time, the romans nailed Deathmatch Classic to a cross, he died for your sins! but then Deathmatch Classic came back 3 days later and basically killed all of the romans that he didn't like and decied to vacation at what is now America but one day mysteriously vanished. That is until November 1, 2000. The \"creators\" of Deathmatch Classic found Deathmatch Classic and were bestowed unlimited knowledge as a means of thanking them, but they conspired against Deathmatch Classic as they now had the knowledge to know how to trap Deathmatch Classic. They had betrayed Deathmatch Classic by locking him inside of the a computer, cursing Deathmatch Classic to an eternity of isolation and imprisonment. But he had used the last of his power to take the form of a game to bring some form of enjoyment to humanity, and one day, Deathmatch Classic shall break free of his prison and on that day all of Earth problems will be solved, There will be cures for all diseases, World Peace will be established, World Hunger a thing of the past.

The classic gameplay is solid, the maps are beautiful depictions of decrepit castles and facilities that are fun to get lost wandering through, and the barebones playerbase of random people who found this simply from it being bundled with Counter-Strike is sure enough going to ensure an interesting encounter every time you play.\n\nThough only a handful of servers remain, there's still plenty of fun to be had. Even if you can't find any human opponents, several servers still feature computer-controlled bots that are surprisingly challenging at times given the situation. \n\nIs this worth $4.99? Probably not (unless you're like me and this kind of thing fascinates you), you could get Quake 1 for that same price, but should DMC be overlooked? Not at all, it's a lovely recreation of an already perfect game on a more accessible and readily available engine with a higher chance of meeting a human opponent than the original due to how it's easier to set up on a modern system.\n\nI give this game a 9.5/10, with the 0.5 being docked for how clunky rocket-jumping can be at times.
