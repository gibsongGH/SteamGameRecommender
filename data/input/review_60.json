When you meet people in this fantastic game it feels wonderful. People that play Ricochet are the nicest players in the entire online gaming community. You chat, say hello, laugh and sometimes even cry. Playing with bots is fun too though. They are skilled and not easy to defeat, so it requires a good reaction and spatial thinking. This game actually makes you grow as a human being, helps you overcome your fears and become a better person in general. The design is also a positive trait. Perhaps you have heard of the cyberpunk. This game uses elements of this genre. Cyberpunk 2077? Bruh, Ricochet did it first. Sometimes I connect to empty servers and just observe the infinte void of the cold cosmos... It makes me feel hella spiritual and philosophical. \n\nSo, in conclusion... If you are a smart person and sagacious gamer you should play this game. At least try. Do not belive in what people say, they are wrong. You can find beauty in simple things. As William Blake once wrote: \"To see a World in a Grain of Sand. And a Heaven in a Wild Flower.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you", "timestamp_created": 1572722498, "timestamp_updated": 1572722498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676124751567840576", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56235342": {"recommendationid": "56235342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170591393", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1536114532}, "language": "english", "review": "besto game in za warudo", "timestamp_created": 1572671717, "timestamp_updated": 1572671717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538463830947876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "56212323": {"recommendationid": "56212323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032529154", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 144, "playtime_forever": 1728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1728, "last_played": 1313823600}, "language": "english", "review": "Du\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu hast mich\nDu hast mich gefragt\nDu hast mich gefragt\nDu hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt\nWillst du bis der Tod uns scheidet\nTreue sein f\u00fcr alle Tage\nNein\nNein\nWillst du bis der Tod uns scheidet\nTreue sein f\u00fcr alle Tage\nNein\nNein\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nDu\nDu hast\nDu hast mich\nWillst du\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1572653585, "timestamp_updated": 1572653585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409395962953567505", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55841568": {"recommendationid": "55841568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272528538", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1513444709}, "language": "english", "review": "Ricochet", "timestamp_created": 1572200969, "timestamp_updated": 1572200969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568733155727386475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55750432": {"recommendationid": "55750432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205485249", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1084, "last_played": 1598402487}, "language": "english", "review": "Ricochet is one of the best games ever made.

(i know, it's shocking someone took time to do it) but most of em work and they are pretty cool, they add new maps that are more than just neon arrow pads.

If you press \"T\" on your keyboard you can spray-paint a chosen icon (can be chosen in settings) you can paint it sometimes or every time you score a point (when you KO somebody). #3. if you press the \"E\" or \"Shift\" on your keyboard it slows your character. #4. When entering a ricochet match a grenade is sometimes displayed in your characters hand, but it quickly disappears when you finish spawning in. #5. If you change the brightness settings at all and the game glitches and does not kick you out like it says it will, then your characters right hand is visible but it looks different than it actually is, it is wearing a black glove and has a brown sleeve, in that weird looking hand there is a grenade (just like i stated previously but it stays in your hand), when holding the grenade you can still throw discs, but when the grenade is in your hand those jump arrows everywhere don't work instead of making you jump they just don't do anything so then you fall to your death.\n\nRICOCHET TIPS: here are my few tips (the game doesn't exactly have many elements to create strategies to) but here they are: #1. when you land and there is someone on the platform you are landing on quickly shoot a decapitation disc at them as soon as you almost land. #2. when waiting on a platform the second someone lands shoot a decapitation shot it's basically an instant kill because people land before thinking all the time. #3. always look around, the maps are really small so unless you look around you will be constantly dying. #4. when a player shoots a disc at you it's not game over either move out of the way or if that is too difficult or not really possible at the moment then shoot normal discs back at those discs it prevents your opponent's discs from hitting you if you shoot a disc at their disc. #5. collect power ups (this one is obvious) it really makes the game easier. #6. isn't it so annoying when you try to get to another platform but you end up landing on it and sliding off the side? well i have a solution to that, as i said earlier if you press \"E\" or \"Shift\" on keyboard it slows your character well it also prevents you from sliding, so when you are about to land on a platform press and hold \"E\" or \"Shift\" it makes the game even easier.\n\nIS THIS GAME WORTH BUYING?: I would say if you have friends playing it with you or there are people on the servers then yes totally, also it'll go on sale for like 49 cents so just get it then.\n\nHELP ME START THIS GAME: normally i would say help me bring it back, but i'm pretty sure it has always been dead you can mod it and it is actually fun with other people also like i said it is almost 20 years old so maybe the devs will be like: \"wow we made that a while ago oh guys look at this there are 400 players online since there are so many players we should give it a 20th anniversary update\". or maybe they'll be like \"Meh\" but either way it'll make the game a lot more fun if we get enough players so you can ask me questions in this discussion send me a friend request or whatever just at least join the discussion.\"\n\n^That Up There Is Everything About The Game....      \n\n!!!!!!!!!!FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!--------------->The Game Is Completely And Utterly Dead, Normally As I Explained In My Post The Game Is Pretty Boring And Pointless, There Are A Few Maps, A Few Power-Ups, And A Rare Chance Of Anyone Being Online, But, If You Get Mods On It.....       .....It Becomes A Lot Of Fun To Play With Your Friends. It Also Goes On Sale For 50 Cents So I Mean You Really Can't Go Wrong It's Like \"Get A Gumball? Or Get Ricochet?\" Most Of The Good User Reviews For This Game Are Trolls. To Sum This Up It's Boring Without Mods, Nobody Online,And Will Make You Laugh So Hard You'll Probably Cry\n\n\n                      -Omastar (pipofthieves)", "timestamp_created": 1571347817, "timestamp_updated": 1571347817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565483450889587402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "55577621": {"recommendationid": "55577621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157714381", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 46, "last_played": 1574992324}, "language": "english", "review": "The pinnacle of human achievement.

One former fan, who wished to remain anonymous, said \"I picked up the game in 2002 after graduating school, and I think it's a fucking disgrace that the sequel is going to a platform that has almost none of the same features as Steam.\". \n\nOthers are excited for it's release on the storefront. Derek Marshall, 12, stated \"I can't wait to play it once, maybe throw that disc thing around for a bit, and then never play it again when the Fortnite servers go back up.\", before chugging a can of Monster Energy and calling his friends over Discord on his medium-range laptop.\n\nIt is not known if Ricochet 2 will ever release on Steam.

One time i met a russian god who just had his airstrafes on point and really taught me how much further there was to go to reach the peak skill level of this game.\n\nRicoc Communindad Hellfish will always stay close to my heart as the best server in the game. Seeing AMX MOD X popups is as comforting as drinking hot chocolate on a cold winter night. The drab tron colour scheme instills a sense of homeliness in me as i turn the game on. Hearing a shop counter beep the exact same way the game beeps before changing maps fills my whole body with nostalgia. The screams of death as people fall of the map will be forever ingrained into your brain as absurd but entertaining moments of your life.\n\nIf you can get your friends to play this masterpiece do so.

Some Valve games, like Left 4 Dead, have an easily-explainable backstory that explains the events of the main game. In Ricochet, the story is, you are throwing discs at each other on floating platforms in space. There is no explanation, there is no exposition; but neither does there really need to be. You are simply throwing discs at each other on floating platforms in space. Nothing else needs to be said.\n\nThe game is fairly rudamentary, featuring less than a handful of multiplayer maps and only (AFAIK) two gameplay modes; good old-fashioned deathmatch, and arena, featuring two players facing off in a number of best-of rounds. The gameplay is simple yet engaging - all players are armed only with three regenerating discs used to knock each other off their platforms, usually meeting their dooms in a death screen you will see very, very often. You can also throw powered discs to decapitate opponents instead. Aside from a couple of disc power-ups, that's it. It is a very easy to learn game.\n\nAs far as multiplayer compatability is concerned in 2019, you can (usually) find at least one server with a couple of players on it for a quick game.\n\nUnless you really want it, however, I would suggest only purchasing it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1562113634, "timestamp_updated": 1562113634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "53234574": {"recommendationid": "53234574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808367806", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1597282354}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a pretty good game to be honest, I'm actually surprised people still play it!", "timestamp_created": 1562100435, "timestamp_updated": 1562100435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "53191753": {"recommendationid": "53191753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090196297", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 15, "last_played": 1561908693}, "language": "english", "review": "I want ricochet 2", "timestamp_created": 1562086614, "timestamp_updated": 1562086614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "53184359": {"recommendationid": "53184359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203643092", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1567244360}, "language": "english", "review": "Ricochet is a very unique game, with a great ideas and some fun gameplay.

While looking through the list of games I got from the pack I spotted this game. I didn't know what to think of it, because I had never heard or knew of this game. I felt like I should've known about it due to it had been made by Valve, but no nothing came to mind. So after I bought the pack I decided to check this game out first to see what its was. Upon booting up the game I went to the server browser to see if I could join a game, but when I looked at the list of servers, they were all empty apart from one. One other person in the whole world was by himself waiting for someone to join him. I join this persons server loaded in, and was instantly confused.\n\nThe way the game is played by throwing discs at the enemy player and either kill them or push them off the map, all depends on the power ups you get and you can only shoot disc's forward. The map you and the enemy fight in is confusing, its not like a normal map but it's a series of circular platforms and the way you navigate through out the map is by standing on arrows that will either take you to the next platform or bounce you to the upper platforms.\n\nThe game is actually pretty fun though I dunno what it is, but I kinda find the game eerie. The skybox is a dark and purple void with no music, and when you fall off the map, your camera will snap above you and start to spin faster and faster as your character screams as he disappears into the nothing.\n\nA big problem with the game is that it is dead.

The gameplay is incredible, it rivals modern day triple A title like no other game has ever done. The gunplay is amazing, I am astounded that they could fit all those physical calculations into their game today let alone decades ago. The graphics are outstanding, you would think you would need a modern gaming pc that cost 2000 dollars to run it but no it runs on a laptop from 2006 with 500 frames per second. This games soundtrack rivals Doom 2016's bombastic song choice while also having very calming songs during moments of downtime. It also has songs for everyone with an amazing selection of music on the ingame radio stations, from modern pop to classic country songs and everything in between.\n\nBut alas ever masterpiece is with its fair share of flaws, \n\nOne con is that there are to many players on at all times causing the servers to lag just enough to be noticeable and annoying. Another problem with so many players is that there is bound to be a few bad apples that ruin the whole batch, it is very sad that streamers have to play on white-listed servers just so they can play this amazing game. \n\nBut all things considered the pros outweigh the cons a million times over. I would advice everyone that reads this to pick up this game even if its price was double what it is now.\n \nTLDR great game", "timestamp_created": 1561326063, "timestamp_updated": 1561326063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "51395572": {"recommendationid": "51395572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002963758", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1339570800}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than Artifact", "timestamp_created": 1561268293, "timestamp_updated": 1561268293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846549630165100098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "51369820": {"recommendationid": "51369820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326380382", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 36, "last_played": 1566606058}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, but why isn't it free.\nIf you've played this game for more than ten minutes you'll realize why it should be free.\nGood Game?

Unfortunately, it has most certainly got the smallest player base of any released Valve game, and you'll be lucky to find many people online. \n\nDespite this, [b] [u] I can honestly recommend it [/u] [/b] as a truly entertaining experience. Incredibly easy to learn. Relatively difficult to master. It doesn't have the largest range to it's gameplay, it's graphics are not great, and it has got literally no soundtrack. But it's fun, and with a friend it can be hilarious.\n\n[u] My tips to you: [/u]\n\n1. Buy it on sale. It's 90% off on every major steam sale. Or better yet, buy it as part of the Valve Complete Pack Bundle, which includes Portal 2 and Half-Life 2, probably the best games ever made.\n\n2. Get friends to play it. If you can guarantee you can find another player, it's a lot more fun then just hoping for a stranger.\n\n3. Enable Raw Mouse Input. This is really for all of Valve's GoldSrc games, the mouse is often messed up if this is disabled.\n\n4. Practise and get good at timing so you can destroy your friends.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

The controls are exactly the same as other Valve games, except the fact CTRL doesn't let you crouch this time.\n\nOther than that, the gameplay is almost the same as every 90s-early 2000s Valve game. The framerate again is amazing. The map is too small to be honest. I'd honestly play it more if there were more people playing the game. If the maps were more creative I'd also play even more than I already do. I'd love it if there were maps that had walls and stuff so you can't see where the other players are, making the game harder.\n\nThe character design is kind of eh. The powerups are actually really good, I love how you can combine more than 1.\n\nThe sound design here is awful. The screaming sound when you fall off of one of those areas gives me a headache. It's annoying and it hurts my ears.\n\nThis game was probably rushed but I still think it's a really fun game. I hope the game gets more active one of these days. I got it yesterday for 49 cents but the game at full price is $4.99.\n\nI don't recommend the game if you don't want to waste money on a game nobody plays. I recommend it if you find an active server. It's quite fun.\n\nFinal score: 60%\n\nAs I said, it was rushed, sound design is awful, character design wasn't that great, nobody plays it too much, maps aren't creative, and that's all I didn't like about this game. I think it had a potential and it still is a really fun game. If you want to buy it though, I recommend buying it during a sale or something. I got it for 49 cents which is a pretty cheap price.

In a time where the industry is striving to make every game as appealing as possible to everyone by allowing the player to play however they please. A game that doesn't just encourage you but forces you to play a certain way, couldn't be more welcome. There is no \"genocide\" path in \"Ricochet\", in fact if you kill a single person on \"Expert Mode\" you'll actually fail the level (I highly recommend everyone playing this game to play on \"Expert\" even if you are new), just stealth forcing the player to learn how to move around the environment carefully. The stealth in this game starts basic and gets fleshed out as the game goes on, but even to this day this is the best stealth game I have ever played. The only real downside to this game is that the \"Dark Engine,\" the game engine that is game runs on, is very clunky for today's standards. But that only really causes some awkwardness in the movement, physics, and the rare moment stuck on a prop. I also recommend that everyone install the \"TFix\" mod, as it allows for play in a 16:9 aspect ratio, and just overall makes the game look better.

But there are some games that are often forgotten, even though many people have them due to buying the Valve Complete Pack. Games like Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Alien Swarm. Some of them pretty good, others - more questionable. So I'm going to review the [i]BEST[/i] one of them: Ricochet!\n\nRicochet is a first person shooter, although I like to call it a first-person thrower: you literally throw discs at each other in hope of actually hitting anyone (and that's a major problem for a reason I'm going to talk about later). It was supposed to be a fun online experience with fast-paced gameplay and small, but complex maps, made in an authentic futuristic style (what else can you call a game full of colored platforms in space?!) There are a few power-ups that might give you an advantage over your hypothetical opponents, like the ability to throw quicker discs, throw three at once and others. You gain points by killing people (pushing them off the platforms mostly), and you get a bonus by [i]ricocheting[/i] the discs off of some weirg diagonal... things. They glow yellow, that's what's important!\n\nRicochet was never supposed to be competitive or serious, it was just a fun experience. So why did Counter-Strike get as popular as it did, but not Ricochet? I actually don't know. The game has one weird quirk: you can't shoot up or down. But that's definitely not the main problem, after all, you don't even need to: it would mess with the gameplay.\n\nSo, what's holding it back? Back in the day - probably, the existence of better, more hyped games in the same package. And a lack of content, I guess. Now? Well, you remember how I said that it's an online experience? Yeah, about that. Ricochet is so innovative, that you could even call it the first singleplayer online shooter ([b]THROWER![/b]) with no bots! No one plays this game. This is an unending cycle of not playing: if there's no one playing, there's no one to play with, so why even bother staying on a server for more than a minute? It's kinda sand, because this kind of game might actually become pretty popular with updated graphics and some [i]actual[/i] players. I'm not able to rate it, because I can only assume what gameplay might have been like, since, erm, no one plays it!\n\nThe only thing left to do is to quietly wait for...\n[h1]RICOCHET 2[/h1]\n\ntldr; best game ever 420/10 would rico the chet again", "timestamp_created": 1543618800, "timestamp_updated": 1543618800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661180496215820313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47193653": {"recommendationid": "47193653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140443683", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6, "last_played": 1558890423}, "language": "english", "review": "Why didn't this appear in the Artifact trailer with the Marvel like intro?

I became suicidal, cutting deep into my wrists and wishing the emotional turmoil would end. I opened up my computer and planned to have one last good time before I ended my pain-stricken and worthless life. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a notification popped up on my desktop, a steam gift, I could only wonder what it was. I finally used my last essence of courage and wonder I had left in my battered and bruised body to open it. Ricochet emerged on my screen. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it, I might as well have some fun on my last day of measly existence. I downloaded and opened the game. A flash of colour, the amazing soundtrack, enjoyment. I came to the epiphany that it had not been a worthless journey. I had rediscovered Jesus. No not Jesus, one who is greater than he, the legendary Gaben. I played it for hours on end. Win after Win. My wife came to her senses and realised the sexy alpha male she was missing out on. She came home, all my children in her hands.\n'I miss you' she cried.\n'Eat a shit Bethany, I have Ricochet now'.\nI slammed the door in that bitches face. I could hear her wail into the cold night air, her cries piercing the air like a gunshot in an enclosed room. She got in the stupid, run down car that she drove, pilling the disgusting fruit of my loins into it. Good, I hope that she died. I returned to my computer to see a notification, Ricochet. I opened it and it was a direct message with a picture attachment, a fully naked Gaben in a silk curtain stared into the camera. The captioning was, 'Hey sexy, if you really love me, you'll put your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in the usb drive, see you soon, x', at first, I was repulsed and confused, but it occurred to me, this was the will of the aforementioned higher power. Of Gaben the Great himself. Without further hesitation, I did as I was instructed, it hurt, but it was a required evil. I became sucked into the machine, Dick first, and arrived in the map 'rc_deathmatch2', and saw a lone figure crouched on the ground, after closer inspection, I realised they were just short. I walked over and saw the familiar angelic face, and glasses, I saw the sly grin spread across his face, he took a step toward me.\n' Hey man, you want some skins', he said sexily.\nI ran and embraced him, lifting him off the ground.\n'I love you, Gaben',\n'I love you too',\nWe stepped off the path and hopped in the Legendary Kart, one seat. Only one/\n'Where am I supposed to sit?' I whined.\n'Oh, about that, you can just sit on daddy's lap' he winked.\nI sat down and felt his raging erection touch the tip of my dick We sped off into the sunset, into a life of wonder and romance.\n\nFin.", "timestamp_created": 1543319128, "timestamp_updated": 1543319128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 135, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833103299140930176", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47099570": {"recommendationid": "47099570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157765505", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17, "last_played": 1515346579}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game with an amazing community, but hold off until VALVe releases the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1543289619, "timestamp_updated": 1561949447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47095981": {"recommendationid": "47095981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199621235", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1532492356}, "language": "english", "review": "epik gaem fir epic gamers", "timestamp_created": 1543284705, "timestamp_updated": 1543284705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507874011993408203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47051239": {"recommendationid": "47051239", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984938155", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 61, "last_played": 1587568954}, "language": "english", "review": "This is what happens when Valve doesn't devour good ideas/devs for profits.

There is no jump or duck function; instead, platforms have jump points that kick you from platform to platform. Scoring a direct hit and kicking another player off a platform into the void is worth one point, as is a decapitation. If your disc bounces once and then hits a player, that's two points.

Combat system is exquisite. There are many beautiful things I can say about this game, such as:\n-Very big community\n-Very nice community\n-Amazing power ups that you can use to your advantage\n-Memorable characters\n-Astonoshing graphics\n-Great variety of maps\n-Amazing gameplay mechanics\n\nThe game is very difficult, probably even more difficult than Garfield Kart, but you will get better with practice. It is amazing with friends, so you should convince others to get it as well. You don't need friends to play though, for there is a big community of bots. The bots are not toxic, making for a great community. I did have some difficulties, for you have to change mouse settings in the options in order to look around, other wise arrow keys are perfectly fine (I don't prefer them). The character models have great personality, with voicelines such as, \"AAAAAAAAAH.\" That's it, but that voice line means a lot to me. The map is very bright and colorful, but not to the point where it is overwhelming. There are bumpers that you can ricochet your discs off of, which gives this game its name. I almost forgot to mention the discs, the main weapon in this game, which you use to bump your friends off the map, granting you a point. There are very little cons. Actually, there is only one con, and that con is there is no ricochet 2 yet. Everyone asks valve for half-life 3, even though this amazing concept of a game deserves a sequel. I wish valve gave this game another chance, for it is full of life. My friend and I have a clan in this game, called {KROCK}, which everyone should join, because we know this game will be an e-sport in a couple of years, so we need to make a team with very experienced players. Ricochet is a beauty of a game. It makes me want to sing Einen Jodler hor ich gern by Takeo Ischi (created originally by Franzl Lang).

You can just tell the developers spent AT LEAST 25 minutes making this game. The graphics are definitely the most beautiful graphics ever seen, with the jaw-dropping neon color pallet that perfectly suits its environment.

In fact, no, it's not a game, it's an [b][u]experience[/u][/b]. Calling it a \"game\" is an insult to Ricochet as it's like comparing it to lesser titles. There just can't be a Ricochet 2 because Valve knows it'll never be as good as the first Ricochet in a million [b]LIFETIMES[/b] and that it would be spitting in Ricochet's face. If you've never heard of Ricochet or even have the audacity to think this masterpiece is [i]bad[/i], then you might as well be blind or deaf or both, because Ricochet isn't just a lesser known Valve game, it was a literal gift from the gods that was rediscovered in the blessed year of 2000. It was found in an underground temple in Death Valley, California. They found hieroglyphics showing that before the settlers came to America, an unknown tribe of Indians praised Ricochet as a god, but looking deeper into the temple also showed that Ricochet is a divine being who has existed before creation itself! And in an unknown time, the romans nailed Ricochet to a cross, he died for your sins! but then Ricochet came back 3 days later and basically killed all of the romans that he didn't like and decied to vacation at what is now America but one day mysteriously vanished. That is until November 1, 2000. The \"creators\" of Ricochet found Ricochet and were bestowed unlimited knowledge as a means of thanking them, but they conspired against Ricochet as they now had the knowledge to know how to trap Ricochet. They had betrayed Ricochet by locking him inside of the a computer, cursing Ricochet to an eternity of isolation and imprisonment. But he had usedthe last of his power to take the form of a game to bring some form of enjoyment to humanity, and one day, Ricochet shall break free of his prison and on that day all of Earth problems will be solved, There will be cures for all diseases, World Peace will be established, World Hunger a thing of the past. So if you're having a bad day, just think about Ricochet, because Ricochet is thinking about you.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/60/Ricochet/", "timestamp_created": 1530472171, "timestamp_updated": 1530472320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548634588718414307", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43193383": {"recommendationid": "43193383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372298536", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5, "last_played": 1573136301}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just sad that nobody plays this.

Unlike other players who have only experienced the glory of Ricochet for 5 minutes of their unproductive waste of lives, I have achieved the euphoric life changing exception to human flaws known as Ricochet for more than 1,200 hours. \n\nRicochet has brought me many gifts, and one of those gifts granted to me is my burned  retinas, allowing a new way of peering into this world, for example, you filthy subspecies can look at something and see smooth seams and vertices, but to me, every defined corner has a distinct glow illuminating even the darkest of voids with the same semblance of a low polygonal object. The people around me are no longer just people to me, for every person I see is just a target waiting for the sweet release of a flung Laserdisc to decapitate them, breaking them from their meager existence that have been ignorant to the touch formed by the greatest thing our Creator Lord Gaben has granted to us. \n\nYou see, Half-Life was put on this Earth to distract the people of the Steam Civilization, which was built in his image to hide the true gift in plain sight. You may ask for some merit for such a preposterous statement, if you can take the time and listen to my story you too will be enlightened by the masterpiece: Ricochet. \n\nOnce I reached 1,200 hours, all servers seemingly went down to reveal only one remaining, the name of this server only contained one letter: G, even though such a queer disruption of my playtime was ensuing, I was blinded by the addictive desire to play Ricochet to pay any attention. It was password protected, but it didn't stop me from trying to breach into the glorious arena, I tried a series of standard passwords such as: Valve, Steam, Ricochet, etc. After a great many attempts, I sat back and thought hard on some clues, the maker of all the things I've dedicated my life to is Lord Gaben, and the server name is just \u201cG\u201d, it all made sense. The password must be: \u201cGabe Newell is GOD\u201d... I was correct, how could I be so arrogant and stupid, it was so obvious and everybody knows God and Gaben are synonymous. \n\nMy router began beaming my request into the entangled web and it shot back connecting me to the server, there, I sat in the goldsource downloading menu which displayed various things that were in a language beyond human comprehension. Once the seemingly endless amount of time I sat there came to an end and I was in the server, my player spawned facing my opponent. The timer rang loud while the anticipation for a glorious fight grew, the same old countdown vibrations that were hitting my ears ended and the game began. \n\nThe other player, which possessed the absence of a player name, began his launch forwards my platform, though he was quick witted hopping from platform to platform with an ease and finesse, my raw aim and skill carried me through the entire skirmish. The points stacked up and time seemed to fade away, my mind was of nothing besides the match. Laserdisc after laserdisc, my arms grew tired, my stomach ached for more snacks, my eyes burned bright red like gems, all biological interfaces stability were now corrupting, but my soul was now even more infused with the game. My opponent no longer seemed like a stranger, I began to know him better than even myself, his play style grew into appearance and his strategical follies were now unearthed allowing me to achieve the first 1,000 points and the victory I strained myself for. \n\nThe host timescale froze, and our characters were now stuck in a dimension absent of change, this broke my flow state and allowed me to tear my eyes away from the luminessence to just stare off into my dark room. This was a good chance to reflect on the event which had taken place just seconds ago. I knew I just finished an accomplishment, but, an accomplishment of what? It just didn\u2019t make sense, why would something like that even happen? Is this real? Or am I in a dream? Before I could ponder my mind into its own world, a barrage of steam notifications came flying to my account, it was from the man I had just faced, his message read as so: \u201ccome look outside,\u201d before I could even finish the message I heard a revving of a powerful engine drawing me from my shitty office chair. There he was\u2026 Gaben standing in front of his 2014 Porsche Cayman packed with a 911s engine. I was ecstatic and ran down to greet him, but before I could speak he put his hand up and spoke\u2026\n\n\u201cQuiet, I know what you\u2019re thinking, lets just go and all your questions will fade away, like shit games in Greenlight.\u201d\n\nWe hopped in Gaben\u2019s 2014 Porsche Cayman, packed with a 911s engine, and zoomed off to Valve Headquarters. I\u2019m not much of a talker, and I didn\u2019t get any more talkative sitting next to my all time hero and man whom is richer than both [i]Oprah[/i] and [i]The Don[/i], but I could tell he wasn\u2019t much of a talker himself as we only spoke once, which was only about his car. He went into great detail about it, especially about his cars mods which he emphasized that they were \u201cpaid mods, just how they should be!\u201d\n\nAfter a couple hours passed and the smoothness of the car ride which brought me a nice nap ended, we were at the doors of Valve\u2019s new office. I busted through the doors and was overwhelmed by all the memorabilia that poured into my senses like a nice big glass of Ruby Red Squirt. Gaben, watched me prance corner to corner in excitement from the entrance, giving a Jolly laugh reminiscent of old Saint Nic (and its rumored they are actually cut from the same bloodline); we spent all day with each other playing Source games and just chatting it up on the latest games, I really got to know the guy on a personal level which was really nice, but we knew this was just an entree to the main meal, a meal of something which was about to shock the gaming world forever.\n\nGaben led me to the janitors closet, that seemed rank until he pulled a secret lever disguised as a stale box of cheez-its, that opened to a lair full of hundreds of programmers and other various game designers, we walked through the legions of workers to Gaben\u2019s Throne. From there he sat high and mighty, drawing the utmost power from it, his voice boomed across the dark den of nerd stench congratulating me on my skill\u2026\n\n\u201c[b]YOU[/b]! Are the chosen one, the messiah, the man which will bring news that will change the landscape of gaming as we know it!\u201d A giant projector dropped down from the ceiling and started beaming what would become everything my life was building up for. \n\nValve\u2019s logo blared with its eardrum piercing music, which melted in with the rest of the cacophony that displayed a timeline of Valve and its image before fading away to a new title, the title formed from all the signature intellectual properties Valve owns to read word for word one at a time: \u201cCounter. Strike. Global. Trade.\u201d \n\nAnd before me was a new Counter Strike game where you cant kill people or do any of the other classic things you would do in a Counter Strike game, as the game was just a fucking excel like spreadsheet meant for trading virtual fucking skins.

I see myself to be perpetually indebted to whatever deity unfurled the momentary lapse and position in which not only is this masterwork accessible, but also that I dwell in the juncture of living among the virtuosos who gave birth to the interactive marvel. How might a single mind solicit to inspect such a transcendent monument? Be forewarned, dear reader, that I, nor any man, could possibly hope to dissect a work of this calibur by his lonesome. Hell, I refuse to consider that an array of one thousand strong could decipher it! However, similar the prodigies that created it, I can only hope to muster the copious amounts of genius pouring from this work and cram it into the confines of the english language.\n\nUpon initiating \"Ricochet\", you are greeted with so much symbolism to consume that most average citizens of our realm would choose to exit such a dense and meaningful screen. It is too much to the man with an anemic consciousness. I hardly know where to start when considering bringing this knowledge to the common people. I shall begin with how the work addresses the aboriginal of life and nature itself--birth. The anterior screen showcases many images, one of which tends to dominate the human's attention, as it is the most leviathan icon currently viewable. The gargantuan circle adorned by futuristic glows and structures is a symbol for the birth of the individual, as well as the birth of man into the technological age. Allow me to elaborate. The neo-digital ring depicted is an obvious allusion to the birth canal that nature devised each human to pass through. \"Ricochet\" proves this by how close up to the circular (or rather, somewhat polygonal) shape the art goer is. The moment is almost demonstrated as if your head is about to pass through, yet you are not quite out yet. You, dear reader, may be asking \"Well, if it were the birth canal depicted, why isn't there a light on the other end? Isn't that usually how the birthing process is shown?\" Well dear reader, you are absolutely right! Keen observation of yours, if I do say so myself! However, this is clearly intentional coinciding the entirety of \"Ricochet\"'s premise. You see, \"Ricochet\" proposes that in a rapidly advancing digital age, you are born into as much shadow as you were conceived in originally, hence the futuristic design of the configuration. Whether or not the craftsmen of this piece intended to imply that we are merely headed in that direction or we have already lived this concept is entirely disputable. There is much, much more to discuss about this object, but for now the picture requires more context, so I shall leave it at that. Moving on to the next point of interest, another image stands out. Yes, the icon associated with the game's title (to be discussed later)--the feature's logo. On first observation, one may assume the logo is but a relapse of something straight out of a 1980's film--font and all. Be that as it may, the visual holds a profound connotation. When the logo is rotated 180 degrees, the image appears to imitate the lower section of a triangle! Of course! Now, as you would assume from such a work, this holds a variety of nuance. However, I will discuss my interpretation of the logo's meaning. You see, the bottom of a triangle can be associated with the masses. The largest in number, yet trampled upon by its aristocratic counterparts. A classic case of the proletariats versus the bourgeoisie. The logo attaches itself with the work--\"Ricochet\". Clearly, the masterpiece's author's intended to represent the common man. Not only that, but the logo suggests something more, as it is rotated so the bottom of the triangle is at the top, The rotation confronts the idea that this piece will give the proletariats the power to overthrow the few that control them and restore power back to mankind itself. While this has not happened, I presume that the craftsmen who administered \"Ricochet\" assumed that would happen. That is one of the major reasons for the game's futuristic settings, after all. \"Ricochet\" shall not bring light to the people until technology and the people have collided with one another, allowing the work's true power to disseminate. Such tenacity bequeaths my soul optimism for our posterity. What beauty to behold, the day \"Ricochet\" provides its rightful nectar to the dry third eyes of the public! Excuse me, I got a tad passionate there. Yet, the principal still stands. I digress, there is more to discuss, and so little allotment for one lifetime! The next immensely abstract element of \"Ricochet\"'s title card are its four options. Of course, an important element to any interactive piece: choice. \"Ricochet\" insinuates that any choice you make can be boiled down into four simple decisions: \"Find, Create, Options, and Quit\". Allow me to elaborate on each of those phrases. Find--discovery, you choose to make a journey of some kind to quench your nature-given curiosity. You may not only find what is on the outside, but also evaluate what is on the inside. Create--to craft, to make something of your own. To use your abilities to craft your own solution to any problem. To create is to show yourself to others, much like the artists of \"Ricochet\". Options--to alter or change how you will solve a problem. You may not solve the solution in the most efficient way, but by changing how you operate, you can avoid any negative feedback one may receive. And finally, quit--to cease, to make null any progress of your heart and mind. To stop evil, or to stifle good. The most threatening and harsh choice of them all. Each of these choices can be intertwined with one another, yet they each build a unique experience. Moving along with my simple observations, the first two options specifically state the word \"Server\", along with \"Find\" and \"Create\". It's my humble opinion that the word \"Server\" serves as an opportunity for the creators to manifest a dissection of religions and their deities and how they are found by many people, and how each and every one of them was also created by many people. A \"server\" is someone who, well, serves another man. Many look to gods as mere reflections of mankind, showing them as forgiving or blessing, rather than a lonesome creator of all. The authors of \"Ricochet\" point out the obvious irony that humankind tends to worship themselves when establishing religions based around gods. These deities, while on a surface level they are higher than humans, are merely there to serve as a torch to show man its way. \"Ricochet\" shows these two options alongside one another to demonstrate how comedic and silly the concept of religion seems to be. While you may not personally agree with those statements (and I may not as well), it is the view of mankind that the work builds. True or not, the work still stands. While there are many more avenues of the starting screen, one man cannot possibly see them all. I, for one, cannot hope to understand every concept displayed. Therefore, I must continue my analysis.\n\nWithout getting into the still immensely compact consequences for selecting one of the phrases, the systems of \"Ricochet\" hold a host of implications. First off, you, the player, control a clearly hominoid individual. You represent a member of the public. A representation of the base of the triangle of class, as discussed earlier. In this future, you are pitted against another bipedal combatant, to serve as entertainment for the bourgeoisie. There is no other explaination of the rediculous colours you are adorned with. It's an allegory for a sport, two opposite teams compete against eachother to entertain--\n\nWait, I'm running out of space!

You are offered basically 1 map, but there are some different maps in the server menu. The basic map works best since there is not so many players in this game. If you manage to find a server with maybe two players in it and join with your friend you can get some really good games and fun times. I seriously mean that. Sometimes you can start a really big game even 10 people might join sometimes and that is probably more than enough to be honest. On the bigger maps more players mean more fun.\n\nThis game might become a bit competitive after playing a while. It is good thing in this game. You can get some powerups which give you different \"plates\" to throw and \"plates\" do different things. For example one throws more than 1 \"plate\" at the time.\n\nThis will not get boring fast. Usually there is not that much people playing so it can get boring because of that... Overall this is really fun game and you should try this. I suggest getting it on sale even though it is only 5 euros. That is because there is so little players nowdays so you do not regret buying this.\n\nGrade for ricochet if it has some players: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1512590203, "timestamp_updated": 1512590203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716346561908721924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38099957": {"recommendationid": "38099957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112749408", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1219, "last_played": 1518945946}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1512557352, "timestamp_updated": 1512557352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481774002313613892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38076567": {"recommendationid": "38076567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180246891", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1467113569}, "language": "english", "review": "If i had a dollar for everyone playing in a server, i'd be living in the streets.", "timestamp_created": 1512469678, "timestamp_updated": 1512469678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505593240261077881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38073384": {"recommendationid": "38073384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343847355", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1503279170}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok so I got this from the \"Complete Valve Pack\" or whatever and it was a nice surprise.\n\nI only played a little bt because sadly, I wasn't alive at the time this game was probably in it's prime (Which probably looked fucking amazing).
