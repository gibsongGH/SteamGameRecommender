What more do I need to say really? [/h1]\nWhat originally started out as a mod for the original Quake game later to be picked up by valve and turned into a standalone title has become one of the most recognizable classbased shooters of all time and people still play Team Fortress to this day with Team Fortress 2 still being a very active game. This Team Fortress game is very identical to the old Quake 1 Team fortress but of course running on the GoldScr engine. I could keep going on and on about how much I love a map like 2fort primarily thanks to Quake's Team Fortress mode but to keep it short there are many cool maps in this standalone Team fortress game too and based on what I hear people still play this game today. If you are a fan of Half-Life or hell just old school Valve then you will probably enjoy Team Fortress but I would probably recommend you go play TF2 if you wanna get serious on the multiplayer side today. I will be talking about Team Fortress 2 soon enough because that's a story for another time but Team Fortress is still fun and does contain some still very cool classes you can play as. \n", "timestamp_created": 1598901057, "timestamp_updated": 1598901057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514563083648681641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "75232107": {"recommendationid": "75232107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978476199", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 165, "last_played": 1485674865}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1598895721, "timestamp_updated": 1598895721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "75196211": {"recommendationid": "75196211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198883116263", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 320, "playtime_at_review": 299, "last_played": 1599099059}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as people say that Tf2 is great, Tfc is still pretty competent. has many of the main functions of Tf2, but somehow feels refined.

While this holy gem will need generations. perhaps even centuries as it has grown to be the giant modern day cultural innovation that we all know and love.

Probably the most interesting feature not present in Team Fortress 2 are the grenades. You'd be surprised to learn that the best flag carrier in game is the Medic with his Concussion Grenades, which allow him to close gaps or jump up to the Sniper spot on 2fort. Some maps are so different from their newer counterpart that I had to look around for a moment before realizing what map I am playing on (Not necessarily a negative). I have to admit though that some chokes (especially Dustbowl) are a pain in the ass when you are attacking. The spam of grenades, rockets, and bullets making it almost impossible to push through. And finally the lack of servers and players.

However this game is still great, but it has almost 0 players on the game, which is really sad, but in all, I would totally recommend this game to everyone, even the ones who hate TF2.", "timestamp_created": 1589132682, "timestamp_updated": 1589132682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510309278964996338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68905884": {"recommendationid": "68905884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245414922", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 84, "last_played": 1593979694}, "language": "english", "review": "its lame init\nits dead like there is no one anymore", "timestamp_created": 1589121190, "timestamp_updated": 1589121236, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68889511": {"recommendationid": "68889511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168885875", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1586432538}, "language": "english", "review": "It would be fun if there were people playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1589096698, "timestamp_updated": 1589096698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68877061": {"recommendationid": "68877061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020058748", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 78719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 78485, "last_played": 1598756293}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game ever based on the game of the century!", "timestamp_created": 1589073582, "timestamp_updated": 1589073582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68832852": {"recommendationid": "68832852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198855655993", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 97, "last_played": 1593311811}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like team fortress 2 but it's like half life 1. :)", "timestamp_created": 1589009721, "timestamp_updated": 1589009721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "68815718": {"recommendationid": "68815718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426684519", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 38, "last_played": 1594607783}, "language": "english", "review": "If I could give this a middle thumbs, i would.

Each character class has a set of weapons and abilities unique to that specific class. This differentiation between classes makes for rock-paper-scissors-esque gameplay that requires teammates to work together in order to effectively achieve the objective.[2] The class-system also encourages players to vary their selection of classes and utilize certain classes in conjunction with one another to gain the advantage.\n\nIn Team Fortress Classic, a server can hold up to 32 players simultaneously, and matches can be played in a number of game modes, each featuring different objectives.\nClasses\nIn Team Fortress Classic, the player can choose to play as one of nine classes: the Scout, Sniper, Soldier, Demoman, Medic, HWGuy, Pyro, Spy, or Engineer. Each class comes equipped with at least one weapon unique to that class, and often a secondary weapon which may be common across multiple classes (typically a shotgun or nailgun). Additionally, each class gets a melee weapon (all classes but the Medic, Spy and Engineer wield a crowbar, a homage to Valve's game Half-Life). Finally, each player carries grenades; the effects of grenades vary, depending on the player's class.[4]", "timestamp_created": 1584643890, "timestamp_updated": 1585277758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491400480270385742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "65109553": {"recommendationid": "65109553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843455346", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1591466381}, "language": "english", "review": "its great for it's time", "timestamp_created": 1584304006, "timestamp_updated": 1584304006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "65068486": {"recommendationid": "65068486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316880087", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 350, "last_played": 1589358539}, "language": "english", "review": "it's alright", "timestamp_created": 1584252696, "timestamp_updated": 1584252696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64982029": {"recommendationid": "64982029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198990126220", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 184, "last_played": 1596830926}, "language": "english", "review": "pyro is fucking op as hell", "timestamp_created": 1584128349, "timestamp_updated": 1584128349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64879391": {"recommendationid": "64879391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210342215", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 45, "last_played": 1596638644}, "language": "english", "review": "*JUMP SOUND x52860054542*", "timestamp_created": 1583957325, "timestamp_updated": 1583957325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516962826251983643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64741070": {"recommendationid": "64741070", "author": {"steamid": "76561199005041014", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1273, "last_played": 1590683684}, "language": "english", "review": "it gud\n", "timestamp_created": 1583722003, "timestamp_updated": 1583722003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64668569": {"recommendationid": "64668569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198846577563", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11, "last_played": 1577666227}, "language": "english", "review": "yes it good bad", "timestamp_created": 1583610927, "timestamp_updated": 1583610927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64668421": {"recommendationid": "64668421", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993023804", "num_games_owned": 689, "num_reviews": 495, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 170, "last_played": 1583583430}, "language": "english", "review": "In my ongoing and likely futile effort to write a Steam review for every game in my library (#270 out of 612)... it's time for Team Fortress Classic.\n\nWith Team Fortress 2, there's not exactly a lot of reason to go back to the original game.

I found myself, however, enjoying this much more than the deathmatch component of \"Half-Life\", the unplayable \"Ricochet\", and the interesting but amateur \"Deathmatch Classic\". There seem to be many more players online than these other named titles, and it makes sense why. I would much rather play a game or two of this than ever touch the rest of their outdated catalog. When I say \"outdated\", I mean unplayable or more bad than good in terms of quality, not all of their games from decades ago. Valve has multiplayer games that were released around that time period that pretty much still stand the test of time to this day, it's just that this group is made up of those that are not so replayable or even enjoyable in the modern day.\n\nOne would be amiss to completely disregard this game just because it isn't really enjoyable by today's standards, as it really did set the stage for what would come, and had its own influence on its peers. Unfortunately, I cannot give a recollection of what it was like to play this game back in its prime, as it is over two decades old, but I can say that it holds up much better than I initially expected, although this doesn't excuse the flaws. Lack of modern multiplayer enhancement spells death for most games such as this, and it isn't necessarily their fault, as these games set the stage for the superior experiences we have now, but they should be judged alongside them in a fair way, not held to a higher standard due to when it was released. \"Half-Life\" was released a few months before this game and I still feel it holds up and is better than a majority of games even to this day, but the same cannot be said for \"Team Fortress Classic\", and the inferior multiplayer which is the only way to experience this game is the main fault at hand. It may be unfair to compare a single-player and a multiplayer experience, but even so, it is worth distinguishing between a timeless masterpiece and a piece of art exclusively great during the time it came out.\n\nOverall, it pains me to say that I can't recommend \"Team Fortress Classic\". Though it is an influential release and was the foundation for what was to come in its sequel and the games it influenced, it does not hold up today. Although there are more active players than most multiplayer games from the same time period, you are still better off playing one of the more acclaimed multiplayer titles in the Valve catalog, this is one you should only experience if you are an avid fan and need some perspective or it bears some nostalgia for you.\n\n[RATING: 6.2/10]", "timestamp_created": 1580974583, "timestamp_updated": 1599511188, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490103393793106079", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "63021631": {"recommendationid": "63021631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198974237890", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 643, "last_played": 1585268117}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1580929408, "timestamp_updated": 1580929408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62931598": {"recommendationid": "62931598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287140398", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2358, "last_played": 1580772467}, "language": "english", "review": "When you wanna play a Half-Life-ish game but Deathmatch Classic is dead.", "timestamp_created": 1580767294, "timestamp_updated": 1580767294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62914985": {"recommendationid": "62914985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153249324", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3152, "last_played": 1583942708}, "language": "english", "review": "EXCUSE ME, I AM IN NEED OF MEDICAL ATTENTION", "timestamp_created": 1580740231, "timestamp_updated": 1580921744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62758524": {"recommendationid": "62758524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074371892", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 23, "last_played": 1577893483}, "language": "english", "review": "The old classic that was the mother of a Legend.", "timestamp_created": 1580509000, "timestamp_updated": 1580509000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "62716230": {"recommendationid": "62716230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198416018133", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 418, "last_played": 1592963103}, "language": "english", "review": "Although there isn't much weapon variety, gameplay variety still exists.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure conversion from QuakeWorld into GoldSource is hard but come on. In TF2, let's say, your class can help tell you the damage each weapon does on each other. For example: Rocket Launchers deal 100 damage, Shotguns do 8-50. Here, the weapons for each class are unbalanced. I don't understand why somebody at Valve will look back at TFC and update it for balancing.\n\nAnother thing: I can barely tell classes apart. I get that 1999 had some heavy 3D graphical restrictions but come on! Half Life was released a year earlier and I can tell each Scientist apart, even coloured to a dark/light shade. TFC could have at least tried making the models look different. I can barely tell who's Scout and who's Soldier!\n\nAnd yes, I get that the game is dead and everyone's moved on to TF2 now. Maybe that's why I don't have as much fun you may say. \"Maybe it's the lack of players!\" Nope. The game itself bores me.

[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*]I like that there's no Domination which is something I don't like in TF2. The reason why I don't like it is because it seeks players to go out to get revenge on a person that keeps killing them over and over again. This system motivates the player to focus more on a single enemy player instead of the objective which detracts Teamwork all together. In TFC it doesn't have Domination, which means I can focus more on the objective and helping my teammates instead of going out to kill someone because I got butt hurt about it. I mean let's be honest, how many people here hates this loud sound after being killed. ~ \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1x-AG-2KXU\n\n[spoiler]You can say that's the charm of TF2 all I can say is, \"sure m8\".[/spoiler]\n\n[*]I like TFC's Community better than TF2's.

Based on the original Team Fortress (yes, this one isn't the first one either), a Quake mod centered around two teams fighting each other, this game offers lots of multiplayer fun. Now, if you're familiar with Team Fortress 2, chances are you know the basics: you play as one of nine classes, as part of either Red or Blue team, and you have to complete different objectives depending on the map; there's the classic modes like Capture the Flag or Control Points, and even a Soccer mode.\n\nThere's not a lot more to add; this game is from the GoldSrc era of Valve games, and such it's limited by that engine. Even then, the maps are very well balanced, and you can see several precursors to classic TF2 maps. I should mention that, while having the same 9 classes as TF2 (plus the Civilian in a special gamemode), most of them play nothing alike, besides sharing the basics. Medics, for example, are much more combat suited in this game; there's no Medigun per se, relaying instead on a Medkit to heal his teammates (or poison his enemies), and the Demoman can set up explosive charges in certain maps to open new paths.\n\nWhile I'd say TF2 is my favourite of the two, this one is a classic, and I've enjoyed it whenever I played it.

Otherwise, I recommend to not get the game if you aren't a fan of classic games, valve games, and like team fortress 2. It would be a waste of money for you if you don't fall into those categories.

It originally started out as a mod for Half-Life, and then developed over time into its own game. If you've played Team Fortress 2, then you should know what to expect, as this is pretty similar. In this game you need to fight against the opposite team as either the red or blue team, as one of 9 classes. All of the classes and most of the gamemodes in Team Fortress 2 are in this game too. Now this game is, of course, older than Team Fortress 2, but it also features things that were cut from Team Fortress 2. For example: throwable grenades for every character.\n\nConclusion: If you had ever wondered what the original Team Fortress was like, and want to try it out, then you should get this game, but not on its own. You should buy it as part of a bundle (Half-Life 1 Anthology, Valve Complete Pack etc.), because even though it's old, it's still nice to see what this game looked like back then.", "timestamp_created": 1563705148, "timestamp_updated": 1563705202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54197901": {"recommendationid": "54197901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018339655", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 151, "last_played": 1590295752}, "language": "english", "review": "Hiugh im highj", "timestamp_created": 1563641100, "timestamp_updated": 1563641100, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463595092296600342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54195486": {"recommendationid": "54195486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233984396", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1562275909}, "language": "english", "review": "it's scuffed", "timestamp_created": 1563630844, "timestamp_updated": 1563630844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507561087608337402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54190418": {"recommendationid": "54190418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198834248449", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8, "last_played": 1562496865}, "language": "english", "review": "Dis game is still rame.

It is the reason that one of the best games ever (Team Fortress 2) exists. I REALLY love this one. So it's an online FPS game where you can play as a certain character, they are all the same as in TF2 I believe, I haven't played TF2 for years and since this new laptop only plays older games, there is not even a way to play TF2 at this point, but maybe when I get a harddrive, I'll be able to play it.\n\nAnyway, TFC is just Team Fortress 2 with better maps, older graphics, different character design (while still having the same names), and the voice is also completely different. The one in Team Fortress 2 is a female and in this one, it is the normal (kind of creepy) voice that tells you when the round will be over or something simple like that. The sound design is amazing, it is a big improvement for all the previous games by Valve, CS did have some good sound design except the voices sounded like they were talking while a fan was on.\n\nThe other things I liked about this game is the character design. Exactly what you'd expect from a Valve game, but with more detail. The characters have personalities in TF2, here it is just Counter-Strike pretty much. But yeah the character design slightly gives off how they might be if they were an actual person. I guess you could say it gives off their personality? I don't really know how to say that one but, yeah, Team Fortress Classic has amazing character design!\n\nThe controls are every other Valve game, as I've said about 2000 times at this point, I've review the entire Half-Life 1 Anthology, Counter-Strike Anthology, and some other Valve games that nobody really talks about anymore. But Team Fortress still holds up and has many nice players that I've met in the game. I've played enough of it to really get good at the game and get to know the community of people there that were actually really cool people. Since TFC is an old game, it is kind of dead, but if you wait around a bit, more people start joining the servers.\n\nBut another thing I am glad about, this was actually a game from the 90s so it wasn't stupid like every other god damn game by Valve (other than Half-Life series, Counter-Strike, and I guess Ricochet...?) so I'm glad about that. The fun I've had in this game was so much fun. I really recommend this game, it goes for 99 cents during sales but full price it goes for $4.99 USD, so it is a pretty cheap game and I recommend buying it if you're into these old games, so yeah, go for it, definitely, I say do it quick because the game might die. It's still pretty active today and I'm super surprised. In 10 or 20 years, Steam might be gone or something or the game may have 0 players on every server. Many Steam games that are multiplayer might have 0 players, unless they are new, so I recommend you to buy this one quick before anything sad like that happens. Anyway, lets get to the final score.\n\nFinal score: 100%\n\nI'm dead serious about the final score. I really am serious. It is pure fun, I REALLY recommend this, I really really REALLY recommend it. It is that good, and I hope you think of buying this sometime soon and I'll meet you there. It is such a good game, a classic. It was out a long time before I even existed but it's still a pretty damn good game. But yes as I've stated millions of times by now, I recommend it. Really. I really really really really really REALLY REALLY recommend it.

Choose a class and head straight into an explosive filled battle, that would make even renouned film director Micheal Bay jealous. \n\nHaving PLayed TF2 I see the similarty in gameplay, despite the age and engine difference beteween the two games. Neither really interest me to an extent but I respect what they hold in value. Read other reviews by players, many have thousands upon thousands of hours of playtime into this game and hold it to high value. I myself fail to the allue that seems to hypnotize some but I still see the allure. \n\nI would probably have more playtime under my belt if it weren't for the lack of a solid playerbase, unlike games such as Day of Defeat or the Half Life Mod Sven Co-op, Team Fortress Classic doesn't have a large playerbase. I have yet to see a complety filled server. Upon playing an active server, you are gretted by players who probably have more playtime into this game than the total lifetime of most TF2 players. Some of the players I have encountered were toxic while some were not, however, everone had their minds set on the objectives-thus making the game a dynamic race to kill everyone else before they vaporize you in a wave of explosive fury.\n\nI don't know much about custom maps or servers in this game due to the low playercount but I assume there is much to behold. \n\nI recommend getting this game on sale, $5 USD is asking too much for a game that might not even have 50 people onlne at a given time.

But this is the fourth movie of the famous series, and we think we know the territory; many of the early reviews have been blase, paying lip service to the visuals and wondering why the characters aren't better developed. How quickly do we grow accustomed to wonders. I am reminded of the Isaac Asimov story \"Nightfall,\" about the planet where the stars were visible only once in a thousand years. So awesome was the sight that it drove men mad. We who can see the stars every night glance up casually at the cosmos and then quickly down again, searching for a Dairy Queen.\n\n\"Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace,\" to cite its full title, is an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking. If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable: This is the first story in the chronology and has to set up characters who (we already know) will become more interesting with the passage of time. Here we first see Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and R2-D2 and C-3PO. Anakin is only a fresh-faced kid in Episode I; in IV, V and VI, he has become Darth Vader.\n\nAt the risk of offending devotees of the Force, I will say that the stories of the \"Star Wars\" movies have always been space operas, and that the importance of the movies comes from their energy, their sense of fun, their colorful inventions and their state-of-the-art special effects. I do not attend with the hope of gaining insights into human behavior. Unlike many movies, these are made to be looked at more than listened to, and George Lucas and his collaborators have filled \"The Phantom Menace\" with wonderful visuals.\n\nThere are new places here--new kinds of places. Consider the underwater cities, floating in their transparent membranes. The Senate chamber, a vast sphere with senators arrayed along the inside walls, and speakers floating on pods in the center. And other places: the cityscape with the waterfall that has a dizzying descent through space. And the other cities: one city Venetian, with canals, another looking like a hothouse version of imperial Rome, and a third that seems to have grown out of desert sands.\n\nSet against awesome backdrops, the characters in \"The Phantom Menace\" inhabit a plot that is little more complex than the stories I grew up on in science-fiction magazines. The whole series sometimes feel like a cover from Thrilling Wonder Stories, come to life. The dialogue is pretty flat and straightforward, although seasoned with a little quasi-classical formality, as if the characters had read but not retained \"Julius Caesar.\" I wish the \"Star Wars\" characters spoke with more elegance and wit (as Gore Vidal's Greeks and Romans do), but dialogue isn't the point, anyway: These movies are about new things to look at.\n\nThe plot details (of embargoes and blockades) tend to diminish the size of the movie's universe--to shrink it to the scale of a 19th century trade dispute. The stars themselves are little more than pinpoints on a black curtain, and \"Star Wars\" has not drawn inspiration from the color photographs being captured by the Hubble Telescope. The series is essentially human mythology, set in space, but not occupying it. If Stanley Kubrick gave us man humbled by the universe, Lucas gives us the universe domesticated by man. His aliens are really just humans in odd skins. For \"The Phantom Menace,\" he introduces Jar Jar Binks, a fully realized computer-animated alien character whose physical movements seem based on afterthoughts. And Jabba the Hutt (who presides over the Podrace) has always seemed positively Dickensian to me.\n\nYet within the rules he has established, Lucas tells a good story. The key development in \"Phantom\" is the first meeting between the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd)--who is, the Jedi immediately senses, fated for great things. Qui-Gon meets Anakin in a store where he's seeking replacement parts for his crippled ship. Qui-Gon soon finds himself backing the young slave in a high-speed Podrace--betting his ship itself against the cost of the replacement parts. The race is one of the film's high points, as the entrants zoom between high cliff walls in a refinement of a similar race through metal canyons on a spaceship in \"Star Wars.\" Why is Qui-Gon so confident that Anakin can win? Because he senses an unusual concentration of the Force--and perhaps because, like John the Baptist, he instinctively recognizes the one whose way he is destined to prepare. The film's shakiness on the psychological level is evident, however, in the scene where young Anakin is told he must leave his mother (Pernilla August) and follow this tall Jedi stranger. Their mutual resignation to the parting seems awfully restrained. I expected a tearful scene of parting between mother and child, but the best we get is when Anakin asks if his mother can come along, and she replies, \"Son, my place is here.\" As a slave? The discovery and testing of Anakin supplies the film's most important action, but in a sense all the action is equally important, because it provides platforms for special-effects sequences. Sometimes our common sense undermines a sequence (for instance, when Jar Jar's people and the good guys fight a 'droid army, it becomes obvious that the droids are such bad fighters, they should be returned for a refund). But mostly I was happy to drink in the sights on the screen, in the same spirit that I might enjoy \"Metropolis,\" \"Forbidden Planet,\" \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" \"Dark City\" or \"The Matrix.\" The difference is that Lucas' visuals are more fanciful and his film's energy level is more cheerful; he doesn't share the prevailing view that the future is a dark and lonely place.\n\nWhat he does have, in abundance, is exhilaration. There is a sense of discovery in scene after scene of \"The Phantom Menace,\" as he tries out new effects and ideas, and seamlessly integrates real characters and digital ones, real landscapes and imaginary places. We are standing at the threshold of a new age of epic cinema, I think, in which digital techniques mean that budgets will no longer limit the scope of scenes; filmmakers will be able to show us just about anything they can imagine.\n\nAs surely as Anakin Skywalker points the way into the future of \"Star Wars,\" so does \"The Phantom Menace\" raise the curtain on this new freedom for filmmakers. And it's a lot of fun. The film has correctly been given the PG rating; it's suitable for younger viewers and doesn't depend on violence for its effects. As for the bad rap about the characters--hey, I've seen space operas that put their emphasis on human personalities and relationships. They're called \"Star Trek\" movies.

new players, as they will be isolated against the swarm of frag grenades and bunnyhoppers. However, if you get to play this over and over again, you will eventually learn new tricks and the things you can do will be amazingly fun, even if you're absolute garbage.\nTFC is comprised of nine classes, all of whom have their own specific niche. Sure, the weapons aren't diverse like in its successor, but the skill required to use all of them effectively is high.\nThe graphics are as you would expect from old Valve games. They haven't aged well, and some of the different classes can look alike in combat.\nThe grenades offer a new way to practice your skill, as the mobility they offer outperforms TF2 in that regard.

The sole objective of it as well the other games mentioned is to find the Amulet of Yendor at the lowest dungeon level and make it out of the dungeon alive, though the game is extremely challenging making some players simply want to achieve a higher score. Just like Dungeons & Dragons, classes (or \"roles\") in NetHack in particular are a very important feature. NetHack was released in 1987.\n\nObviously, this is not the first instance of classes in video games, but this was just over 5 years before the release of Wolfenstein 3D, a first-person shooter which could easily be played with a top-down perspective, that is too influential to the genre for 1 review to describe.\nFast forward to 1996. Quake, a fully 3D first-person shooter is released, and soon after a modification for the game called Team Fortress.\n\nTeam Fortress is, because it is a Quake mod, a first-person shooter, putting it into the same bunch as Wolfenstein 3D and the DOOM games, which again, might as well be top-down (and if not for advancements in technology, this would also apply to Quake and Team Fortress). The game has several classes to choose from, each having their own unique strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and uses on a team of players expected to complete clear cut objectives, such as capturing the enemy team's flag. This game has been remade on newer engines such as Goldsrc (in Team Fortress Classic) and Source (I'm not going to bother listing even a sixteenth of them), as well as even \"demade\" on some older engines.\n\nThese days, the servers of the games created before the direct sequel, Team Fortress 2, are mostly empty aside from a handful of highly populated ones, forcing you to play on your own if you have anything against those servers.\n\nNow wait a minute... Classes? Clear cut objectives? Playing on your own? Tossing in the unfunny joke about DOOM being top-down?\nThat's right, Team Fortress is a complete ripoff of NetHack.\nYou TF2 players can fuck off with your whining about Overwatch, the whole series is just a reskin.", "timestamp_created": 1511927047, "timestamp_updated": 1512206272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493962705135345459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37917865": {"recommendationid": "37917865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297628284", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 19, "last_played": 1549131648}, "language": "english", "review": "TF2 is much better but this is still a great game", "timestamp_created": 1511924696, "timestamp_updated": 1511924696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529035568237304688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37885114": {"recommendationid": "37885114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175343402", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 37, "last_played": 1517266196}, "language": "english", "review": "boi it really fast to get in a game like 1 min max", "timestamp_created": 1511879051, "timestamp_updated": 1511879051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506172835826873779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37706255": {"recommendationid": "37706255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353731251", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 12, "last_played": 1511712858}, "language": "english", "review": "LOLOLLOLO", "timestamp_created": 1511722631, "timestamp_updated": 1511722631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37641921": {"recommendationid": "37641921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346472748", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 57, "last_played": 1516425187}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1511688604, "timestamp_updated": 1511688604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498257845640182495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37606428": {"recommendationid": "37606428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154812860", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 69752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 56422, "last_played": 1599885895}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply best game ever made!

In the case of this game, I'm pretty sure all of those little \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s regret being born in \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing Scotland, the only country where this\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665won't get you a court date.

this game would be the outcome. If you want to know where TF2 sort of started, then you're in for a fun time. It retains all of the classic Quake sound effects, the wacky physics of the GoldSrc engine, and the classic class-based gameplay that Team Fortress is known for. I've owned this game for a long time (in fact, I've owned this since I created my Steam account,) but I never got around to writing a review for it until now. The classes have COMPLETELY different weapons and playstyles compared to the sequel's counterparts. The spy has a \"feign death\" option, but no invis-watch, so you need to have good timing and hide in the shadows when playing Spy. Every class has a shotgun or nailgun of some kind, sometimes even both. Every class has grenades, so every class can jump across the map just as their heart desired. Just imagine a Medic jumping across the map with a Nailgun, completely obliterating people. Oh, did I mention that the Medic can infect a player on the opposing team with a deadly virus? No? Well, he can. Here are some other pros and cons about this game:\n\nPROS:\n*A whole butt-load of fun\n*A relatively inexpensive game\n*Graphics are still decent for today's standards\n\nCONS:\n*Has a sequel\n*The sequel is free\n*The sequel has hats, weapons, and a NEW UPDATE that came out a few days ago.\n\nTo be honest, I think if you're buying this with the rest of the Half-Life Anthology, you'd be getting a very good value. But, I don't think you should get it standalone. Although the game is fun, it stopped getting updated at around 2004 with its Steam Update. The sequel is free, so if you want to play Team Fortress, play the second one. I still recommend this to people who either want to get the entire Half-Life Anthology or are just curious about what Team Fortress looked like during the Early 2000s.\n\nFinal Score:\n9 Flying Medics out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1508799091, "timestamp_updated": 1508799091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.65398097038269043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35940980": {"recommendationid": "35940980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373847005", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 29, "last_played": 1551321066}, "language": "english", "review": "i love rocket jumping!!!!!!!!\ni love Quake!!!!!!\ni love TF2\nand also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnobody plays with me though\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1508750628, "timestamp_updated": 1508750628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496085703372955322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35931681": {"recommendationid": "35931681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308940391", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 83, "last_played": 1507973778}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game because i love tf2 i will say its not as fun as tf2 but it still has inttesting gameplay and i reccomend it.", "timestamp_created": 1508706703, "timestamp_updated": 1508706703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35912071": {"recommendationid": "35912071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137644838", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 55, "last_played": 1505893415}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game it has things that tf2 did not have like playing dead as spy all you do is lie down on the ground dead wait till some one walks past then stab them to death and yea its a fun game and it is mostly dead but that is alright its just the people who still plays this game is good at the game", "timestamp_created": 1508654396, "timestamp_updated": 1508654396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5868338942527771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35855309": {"recommendationid": "35855309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100421622", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 122, "last_played": 1483595381}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was great for its time, however with TF2 out and free it falls behind.\nbefore, it was great;

For those of us born in the 80s who were there for the advent of FPS games and then also online gameplay, this and the other early Half-Life mods are some of the true cornerstones of some of the most eternally excellent gaming exoerience off all time. I remember playing this around 1999 or 2000, I had traded my friend from Junior High burnt copy of Rainbow Six Rogue Spear for an actual copy of Half Life, and this was before Serial Codes were really enforced as they are now, and this was before Steam too, there was the Sierra online network and WON IDs. Phenomenally grand memories of badass battles and classic funny moments that can take place during a game. This is one for the ages, and I played a ton of Counter-Strike back then too. Along with Action Half-Life (an amazing stylized-action movie style mod) and Firearms (a great approach to early realistic combat, with a vast array of weapons) and then there was The Opera, and Natural Selection. But they all came from the first, which was this, Team Fortress Classic (which yes, is techically a remake from a Quake mod, but IMO better in a handful of notable ways). So that's why I wanted to write a review for this awesomely eternally replayable online multiplayer team-based FPS game. I remember playing in Drippy's 2fort server and ViBig before I'd go to school in the mornings, it was so fun being able to play online through fast cable internet against other people probably doing the same thing. That's why this game is important, it's arguably one of the best multiplayer games of all time.
