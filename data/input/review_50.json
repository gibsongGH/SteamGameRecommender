Playing on hard was challenging, but not frustrating apart from the occasional Worms-esque moment when an enemy throws a grenade vertically 15ft through 2 doorways only for it to land perfectly on your face. Clearing a dark warehouse crawling with semi-invisible black ops feels great.  \n\nNot crazy about all of the new weapons, found myself only using the detached Barnacle when absolutely necessary, same goes for the Desert Eagle, and Spore Launcher. Also, while it's not exactly HL's thing, more sniper ammo would've been pretty gosh darn sexy.\n\nIt took me about 10 hours to complete on hard, well worth the 99p I paid for it. The only thing that really hindered me was the occasional crashes; at certain points, be they particular rooms or particular corridors if I was using deployable explosives, sometimes the game just crashes.

It's way more inventive for a start, instead of a flashlight you have night-vision, this isn't only a nice little feature but also crucial when you reach a handful of parts in the game where you're plunged into complete darkness and rely on it to find your way around. There's also a neat new weapon which sits alongside your two melee weapons which is a barnacle you can fire at certain green wall-dwelling creatures to grapple your way across the environment just like the Grappling Hook in the Zelda games! Why this wasn't used again in HL2 I'll never know\n\nAs with Blue Shift, Opposing Force takes place alongside the main game Half-Life, only this time instead of playing as our usual silent protagonist Gordon Freeman, you take control of a military dude who is part of the first wave sent in to kill Gordon Freeman. No spoilers but if you have played through the original Half-Life game you'll know that things go very wrong and that even the first wave sent in to \"fix the problem\" was only the beginning of a huge operation.\n\nOpposing Force isn't very long, obviously your first play will be your longest. I took my time, but when you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing (or you're just very good at these older, cooler FPS games) this game can be done within 60 mins or so. That being said there's plenty of moments which will bring a smile to your face, whether you recently finished HL or not, you'll still recognise some areas or even the exact messages being spoken over the radio transmitters. Oh and you'll also see the mysterious G-Man, who also speaks this time (first time he speaks in the franchise? Not sure, maybe)\n\nOverall a great expansion, I would recommend for the reasons that I've given above, although I would strongly recommend a play of the original game first in order to make the most out of it.

In my opinion, this is how to make an expansion to an already awesome game. You play as Adrian Shepard, a Marine sent in to contain the Black Mesa incident. The tutorial has you navigating through a boot camp and introduces many of the new mechanics such as rope climbing, how your P.C.V. (Powered Combat Vest) works, and how your night-vision goggles function. This game features many new weapons and tons of new enemies from a completely different planet. Some of the new weapons are the Desert Eagle handgun, a M40A1 Sniper Rifle, and many new \"alien\" weapons. This game also features new AI squad members, some of which can heal you, open sealed doors or just help out with some extra firepower. The beginning of the game takes place around \"Surface Tension\" in Half-Life, even showing Gordon Freeman being captured. Many other references to Half-Life's events are cleverly placed. I think that if Valve were to use Adrian Shepard again, he would make an awesome protagonist for another game set in the Half-Life universe.

Rather than an employee there such a scientist or security guard, you\u2019re in the boots of Alan Shepard, a member of the HECU unit in the USMC tasked with quelling the ongoing incident at Black Mesa. However due to the circumstances at hand when you arrive, you won\u2019t be at odds with the surviving scientists and security guards at Black Mesa, but a whole new group of aliens in addition to the ones encountered in Half Life. In addition to the new enemies, you will be exploring new areas of Black Mesa and will be armed with a new set of weapons, both HECU issue and of out of this world. But in your quest to survive against the alien onslaught in the wake of the resonance cascade, you will also be working with HECU members at times, although despite their wonky ai at times, will prove useful in fighting against enemies while also progressing through the campaign, which isn\u2019t as long as the standard Half Life campaign but is still long enough to leave the player satisfied. \n\nThe puzzles and level difficulty is on par with Half Life but the scenery and enemies will be different. The tutorial mission isn\u2019t in Black Mesa but instead at boot camp/training, which explores new game functions and mechanics while also showcasing much of the new weapons in the game.

It's what many expansions are; a mini version of the base game, condensed and less ambitious, but the same formula. It is more Half-Life, not better Half-Life. It does have a bit of a different style which is refreshing, as you play as a Marine in an overdone comedic gung ho style.\n\nYou revisit parts of Black Mesa seen in Half-Life, but you will see different parts of these locations. The level design doesn't bring anything new to the table, although the final maze-like encounter with black ops enemies is one of the best combat encounters in the series. \n\nThe \"puzzle\" gameplay (solving practical problems to navigate the environment) is less clever than in Half-Life, which wasn't outstanding in this regard either. But Opposing Force is more focused on combat where it does present more challenge than Half-Life especially due to some of its new enemy types, but for the most part more forgettable levels. \n\nAfter all, Half-Life never excelled in gameplay, rather it excelled in presentation, and the presentation and general structure of Opposing Force has less memorable moments. Opposing Force also has a new set of weapons placed in rather lazy but logical places, and like Half-Life a number of these weapons are never ideal to use in any situation, therefore this lacks the intelligent weapon design seen in games like Doom, Quake, and Unreal most of all. \n\n[h3]Strengths[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Amusing over the top gung ho marine style, Opposing Force has character\n\n[*]Decent new enemy types that pose a greater combat challenge\n\n[*]Some cool tie-ins with the original game\n\n[*]A few new types of combat encounters, particularly more maze-like ones that sometimes use pitch darkness against you to encourage night vision use (the game had to make use of the new night vision goggles after all)\n\n[*]Fairly interactive world like in the original game\n\n[*]The Desert Eagle with laser sight is a cool new weapon\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Weaknesses[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Once again many of the weapons are never ideal for any situation, the creativity and intelligence behind weapon design isn't great (a flaw shared by the base game)\n\n[*]Friendly AI that you can command is very dumb\n\n[*]Only 2 channel audio ever since Valve broke it years ago\n\n[*]The \"puzzle\" gameplay (practically getting past environmental obstacles) is rather uninspired and lacks creativity, a downgrade over the base game in this regard which already wasn't the most intelligent here\n\n[*]Hardly any secrets on any level\n\n[*]Encourages cover shooting at times despite not having leaning or iron sights, although it does this less often than the base game\n\n[*]Final boss is one of the lamest and laziest I've ever seen in a game\n\n[*]Features Half-Life's overly slidey movement that lacks precision, not the best feeling FPS game\n[/list]\n\nOverall it's decent, but you're honestly not missing much by not playing this.

None of these ideas are implemented [i]perfectly[/i], but they totally change the way that Half-Life plays in the right way.\n\nI have a few complaints about the game as-is, such as how the new rope-swinging mechanic is fiddly and feels out-of-place, and the game's habit of throwing tanky monsters at you ad nauseum, but for me it was a pretty solid four out of five experience through and through, and more than worth the five dollars Valve is asking for it.

Your soldier buddies are a great addition and have actual use, unlike the scientists of Black Mesa and the pea-shooter security guards.\n\nMy only criticism of this near - perfection of a video game is that the final boss is one of the most underwhelming things I've ever fought, not to mention incredibly easy, even on Hard. \n\nI can only pray that Corporal Shephard will return to us someday.", "timestamp_created": 1596927615, "timestamp_updated": 1596927615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73993846": {"recommendationid": "73993846", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316391648", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 455, "last_played": 1596919513}, "language": "english", "review": "I never had the chance to play the expansions of Half Life back then, so I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this one.

Both narratives happen in parallel, and if you played Half-Life before you will better enjoy the events seen from a different perspective, although it's possible to do so without having finished Half-Life before.\n\nThe game is shorter, about a third or half the original. There are some new enemies and weapons that keep things fresh. Jumping puzzles are not as frequent or as frustrating as the original, and rope mechanics, having been so criticized by many, do not interfere with gameplay at all. In fact, the game ends up being even more fluid than the original.\n\nOpposing Force is a good example of what an expansion should look like, increasing the content of the original game, adding things that renew the gameplay and reducing the size of the campaign so that it doesn't get tiring.", "timestamp_created": 1596399780, "timestamp_updated": 1596399780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73669529": {"recommendationid": "73669529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451694930", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 277, "last_played": 1596398643}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a review, just a recommendation.", "timestamp_created": 1596397135, "timestamp_updated": 1596397135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631668150424957275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "73668737": {"recommendationid": "73668737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286529793", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 429, "last_played": 1596390041}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the many problems later in the game with the absolute ungodly amounts of annoying enemies (the sewer area, etc.), the game's additions are for the most part nice and and the overall game is fun.

He is one of the soldiers sent to the Black Mesa Research Facility to eliminate the Xen invaders. The new enemy types are the race x aliens. I like them but some of them are quite annoying. There are lots of new weapons and every weapon is good, my favourite new weapon is the Saw. The Saw is a Lmg that has lots of fire power but you only get it in the middle of the game. The crossbow has been replaced with an actual sniper rifle. There squad members around Black Mesa and they can help you in lot of things. The engineer can cut through sealed doors or floor grates with his welding torch. The medic can heal you or  other soldiers. You can use the radio to get information where to go.

If you're look at this, you likely already know that. But there are some seriously jarring issues.\n\nThe biggest are the glitches. This isn't some random Steam title, this is a first party Valve Software game, and the fact that you have to jump constantly on elevators not to clip into the floor, and that even the patches aren't a guaranteed fix, to say nothing of vent clipping (forcing a reload and to autosave constantly) is draining and immersion breaking. There is no excuse not to have this fixed. I recommend going into Discussions and reading about all the glitches before playing so you don't wind up saving only to find you're stuck in the floor. \n\n Beyond this, on the whole the challenge increase is for the most part appreciated, but OF has the bizarre award of some of the best combat situations and level design in all of Half Life, and also some of the worst. The Sewer section is strange, entirely dark (making levers and buttons hard to find and get used to that migraine inducing green filter...) and will outright require trial and error (with death guaranteed with the enemies you deal with down there in claustrophobic tunnels) as you navigate a maze with nothing but instant kill beasts around every corner until you simply memorize where they are. And the only section I can immediately recall with an INFINITE amount of enemy spawns. \n\n It's a petty issue, but I like going for 100% kill runs, and it's a mild annoyance that you cannot do that with this title. To add to that, the game has a ton of meat that unless you're checking walkthroughs you would never know otherwise. For instance, there is a weapon that allows you to teleport to Xen for goodies. \n\n Except you can go to new areas every chapter, which is an awesome inclusion. The game never tells you this.  There are conveyance issues, and again, while a GREAT super fun action thrill-ride, the amount of Trial and Error is a bit obnoxious.

Half Life's introduction allows the player to immerse themselves in the world, but Opposing Force goes straight into the action.

Don't even get me started on the fucking pit drones.\nI played through the campaign in both hard and easy difficulty, and there was absolutely no difference.\n\nThe Vortigaunts are placed in ways to ambush the player, but the problem is that they typically damage you when there is nothing you can do about it, since they are either placed in hard-to-kill spots, or you have no ammunition left. There is also a severe lack in medkits during these sections, requiring sv_cheats 1 if you save in a bad spot.\n\nI also had to noclip out of certain floors or walls, because the game is so fucking bad that it lets you get stuck in them.\n\nThe final boss was underwhelming as well, and violated the basic rule of the Half-Life series: show a way that you can beat your enemies.\nI was stuck on it for a while because HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW TO SHOOT THE GODDAMN PURPLE BALL?\nThroughout the early days of the Half-Life series, balls of energy have been shown to teleport, so I thought that I would have to go in the ball. The game didn't let me.\nThen I realized you could shoot out the eyeballs of the alien. Thought that if you shot them out enough times, it would kill it. After about 10 times of shooting out the eyeballs with no change, I realized this wasn't it.\n\nThe weapons are also unbalanced. Some guns are weaker than a peashooter, while others are stupidly good. In the end, it doesn't even matter, since you won't have enough ammo to fire these guns in the first place.\n\nAlso, who decided to make the Black Ops tanks? You cannot kill them with a FULL SMG MAGAZINE. ON THE EASIEST DIFFICULTY.\n\nThat being said, this mod had its moments. During the times when it wasn't obscenely difficult, the campaign was loads of fun to play through. I only recommend this game to the die-hard Half-Life fans, since the only reason I slogged through the frustrating parts of the campaign was to say that I had beaten the whole Half-Life series.\n\nI might play through it another time and edit my review, but for now, I would rather play Hunt Down the Freeman.

One of my favorite things to do in a video game is play the antagonist, experience the not-so-heroic side of things. This game nails that perfectly. From killing civilians to chasing Gordon Freeman ever-so closely makes this game an incredibly different experience that we've come to enjoy and know from Half-Life.\n\nAnother great element was the huge amount of new weapons and enemies that aren't seen in Half-Life. It gives this game it's own personality and really makes it stand out among the other games in the franchise. So many unique elements in this game, things completely exclusive to this game.\n\nOne of my least favorite things from Half-Life and Blue Shift were the Xen levels, however. But here, Opposing force did that well, too. You go to Xen for possibly a grand total of 5 minutes in this 6 hour game. It's not that I don't like Xen, it's just the level design in those parts consistently tended to fall apart in those segments.\n\nThis game also greatly encourages working with your squad. Whenever they present to you a fellow soldier in the game, shortly after, there will be a series of hostiles that you could take by yourself, but would prove to be a bit tough, even with all the weapons the game gives you, but would prove an absolute cake walk with a team. Which is great, because, this way, you don't feel like an all-powerful God that nothing can stop, instead you just feel like a guy... with bottomless pockets to fit 20 guns.\n\nMy only gripe is that at times the level design was a bit questionable. The path forward wasn't always that obvious, and sometimes kind of, well, dumb. It's not often that I feel this, and it's never that bad, it's just... odd at times.\n\nOverall, I give Half-Life: Opposing Force:\n\n9.2 Weaponized Barnacles out of 10\n\nYeah, the weaponized barnacles might have been one of my favorite weapons.

It has new weapons that Gordon Freeman and Barney Calhoun (*cough *cough Half Life Blue shift) didnt get such as 357 desert eagle, m40 sniper rifle, displacer...etc, more story about later stages of Black Mesa incident......and well........ more everything.

So when I played Opposing Force I went in thinking that it would also feel pretty meh but I was quite pleasantly surprised about how good Opposing Force actually is\n\nTo start off with the good: The Story is quite interesting as you are put in the shoes of a Marine by the name of Sheppard who is sent with other marines by the U.S Government to eliminate all Black Mesa employees and erase traces of the incident. Along the way you will face off agaisnt many aliens you have come used to in Half Life but later on you also will face off against some other new enemy types which I will not spoil here for those who have not played the game. but they are definitely different and add more flavor to this expansion\n\n\nThis expansion also adds many new weapons to the mix all of which feel great, you now have a wrench and a knife both functioning as melee weapons, Night Vision goggles replacing your flashlight, A Sniper Rifle, A light Machine Gun, An Energy Pulse hand, A Barnacle Hand, A Desert Eagle pistol and more. All of these new weapons add a lot of new layers to the game and make the game feel truly unique and fun to go through.\n\nAnother plus is that the level design is more straight forward and simple compared to the mazey and at times quite annoying levels found in the Original Half Life, The levels do have their fair share of puzzles but they are all well done imo and thankfully you have no annoying sections such as On A Rail\n\n\nThis game is also decently long for an expansion, I finished it in 8 hours myself and it felt like the right length, there is also a final boss which is pretty tough.\n\n\nOverall I feel that this expansion for Half Life 1 really surpasses the Original game in every way and feels like it's own game with all of the new things they crammed into here. Imo it's easily the best game in the Half Life Franchise and if you are a fan of the series you definitely should check this game out, it goes for pretty cheap on steam being only 5 dollars normally and it goes on sale very often so really you should pick it up.

Here, You are the opposing force thus the name of the title which is so cool :D You are Adrian Shephard, A United States Marine sent in to the Black Mesa Research Facility to kill none other than Gordon Freeman himself. The game has everything that makes Half life so memorable and one of the best shooters of all time but it also has such a cool story and so many cool weapons too not to mention the one and only Adrian himself as he is a total badass. If you haven't played Opposing Force I would recommend it. The cool thing about Opposing Force is that it seems like a remake will be a thing and I hope it's the case because I would love to have a remake of Opposing Force just as we had a fantastic Remake of Half Life called Black Mesa so I cannot wait to see how it will be like to play :) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YACtJZnDjQ0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNmIFftk-9c\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saJuTDYzIHM", "timestamp_created": 1589902722, "timestamp_updated": 1599064183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "69397968": {"recommendationid": "69397968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191572617", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 699, "last_played": 1590504652}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game that really adds to the og half life experience - it's a shame Shephard seems to have been forgotten.", "timestamp_created": 1589855496, "timestamp_updated": 1589855496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "69362787": {"recommendationid": "69362787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011832065", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1589803034}, "language": "english", "review": "great game, great franchise:)", "timestamp_created": 1589804842, "timestamp_updated": 1589804842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "69326503": {"recommendationid": "69326503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091688807", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 716, "last_played": 1589759250}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, but there is an issue with mouse look in widescreen mode, same as in Blue Shift.\nFor me it fixed itself by going back from widescreen to normal, disable joystick, anable raw input.

There's a lot of recycling from the first game, obviously, but also many new weapons --some of the best in the franchise-- and new enemy types. And, of course, more of those memorable Half Life moments and set-pieces. If you liked the original, jump straight into this one. It's got a somewhat different vibe: there are fewer large-scale set pieces, more corridor shooting, more difficult gun-play due to the new enemies, and even more puzzle platforming -- which is an acquired taste, but works pretty well here, because the platforming, in general, is less tricky and more straightforward than in the original, more about figuring out the route than landing precise jumps. I played on Hard, though, and I have to say the final third, while still good, dragged on a bit. The fights get harder, bigger, longer, and more frequent, and the bullet-soaking enemies get more numerous. I do think the original switches things up with more panache and sense of pacing. That said, this doesn't mean Opposing Force takes a nosedive or anything like that, and the final boss is definitely an improvement over Half Life's.

You get knocked in the first minutes and aimlessly go until you see that the army is leaving the Black Mesa Lab and you hear the classic \"Forget about Freeman\" line but from the other side as the game leaves you with more questions.

It adds more weapons, mechanics, and good level design. Every part of the game has been improved upon, that being said there is one major problem,\nEverything in this game is pointless, sure it fleshes out the story a bit but no new weapons ever return, nor do any new enemies. For as fun as this game is it will forever be a footnote to the first game and that's a shame because it's really fun.\nThough a lot more feels pointless than the entire game. For example you get the sniper and then immediatly head underground for the rest of the game. Why give players the sniper when after the first fight it is in it will never be used again? I feel that way with a lot of the new weapons, it's a lot of nothingness that you will only use when you run out of ammo, which was never an issue for me. If you liked Half Life then you will like this game and they are commonly sold together (i know i got them in a bundle). If you are coming from Black Mesa though this game may be a bit of an odd one for you. \nHonestly, it's probably my favorite half life game but it will always be overshadowed by the main series.

The game? Yes. Is it worth 5 bucks? Maybe. Is it better than Half Life 1? Defintely not.\n\nI knew that this was originally a DLC, and that it isn't supposed to be long, but 8 hours? This doesn't even reflect the actual time it takes to play this (I am pretty slow when it comes to FPS games, and I also had to load my saves a lot).\nThis game gives you a new perspective, you are now playing as the \"meanie\", the one sent to massacre Black Mesa and kill Freeman. I like this new perspective and find it a good addition to the lore of the franchise. \n\nYou get new weapons and new enemies (which are challenging, I have to admit). The weapons are really cool and useful (Also, you get 3 new Alien buddies instead of just one like in the base game).\nMy favorite part of the game was the first boss, the Pit Worm, mainly because it was just one long puzzle. Yeah I am aware that it's a straight copy of the Tentacles from the main game, but who cares. It made me use my brain.\n\nOther than the fact that it's short, the only thing that made this such a letdown was the ending. Not the cool Gman cutscene, but the final boss. It took me more than an hour to beat a 15 minute boss, mainly because my rockets went through the boss instead of actually hitting it, which made me think that I needed to target other parts of the boss's body instead of the parts that actually take damage. The boss was so boring that I thought that I still had 8 more hours ahead of me, And I was so disappointed when I saw the Gman appearing in front of me and the credits starting to roll by.\n\nOverall, it was a fun revisit to the Half Life world, but it was just hyped too much.

It tells the story of the military sent to clean the alien threat from Black Mesa while eliminating any witnesses. You are Adrian Shephard and you don't actually take part in the \"eliminating witnesses\" part. Instead, you are a badass soldier who is very much like Gordon Freeman, a one man army with a wopping selection of weapons to choose from. You gain more than Gordon does and each one is creative to a degree and somewhat helpful to traversing the terrain or unleashing hell.\n\nThe story is simple, as described, but like Blue Shift, your actions interlock with Gordon's as he is causing chaos around Black mesa. You always seem behind him, but eventually move onto a different path as another bunch of alien races interfere with a war between the US military and Black Mesa itself. There's less of a horror side to this expansion, as you feel more like Marcus Fenix, feeling almost bulletproof. It's a blast playing as this soldier, there's so many more enemies to blow away and more varied ways to eliminate them. Overall though, it's more Half-Life with some great additions, even if it can feel a bit much at times.\n\nThat's a lie. This game ramps up in difficulty at some point. The new aliens are there to push you against a corner and the Black Op soldiers punish your ammo. You'll see less standard, recognisable enemies. They are nothing to your arsenal. The difficulty is welcome at times but other times the AI is too quick to react to your movement and they will fire first when you turn a corner. \n\nBesides that, the only other negative I have is how there's less dialogue. You don't have scientists telling you what's happening or what you're meant to be doing at times. I got stuck in an elevator shaft with hanging sparking wires indicating danger. I didn't know I had to climb the safe rope to get higher as I saw a welcoming path at a lower level and so there I spent a while walking in circles wondering where to go next. Who would think a rope would be climbable in a Half-Life game, especially when it looks just like the sparking wires next to it.\n\nBut yes, this game is great and offers a good side story with about 3 hours worth of gameplay if you take it slow.

I'm not sure if they talked about this in the Boot camp, but whatever.

Obviously it's recommended that you play Half-Life before playing this expansion. New weapons and monsters are introduced as you fight your way through Black Mesa during the incident infamously started by Gordon Freeman. Of course, the game is old and doesn't hold up graphically, but the gameplay is still pretty tight. It feels more like a corridor shoot-em-up than a continuation of any story, as it's told from a different perspective of an event we already know about.\n\n[h1]My Full Review[/h1]\nI recommend this game overall to any active or soon to be Half-Life fans. If you're looking to learn something new about the story, this isn't it. This expansion is more dedicated to the gun play than anything else. The puzzles aren't too hard to figure out, and the environments aren't anything you haven't really seen in Half-Life. The encounters are quite brutal and a lot of trial and error is involved.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere are plenty of new weapons to use as you make your way through the game. With more weapons comes a LOT of enemies per level. You'll spend a lot of time using cover and peeking to get shots off on some of the tough enemies, as they tend to sponge a lot of damage and hit hard.\n\nPuzzles are present, however they aren't too difficult. I suggest learning how to crouch jump if you're not familiar, because there are a lot of areas that assume you'd know how to do this. There are some sections that aren't immediately obvious as to what you should do either, so keep an eye on all of your options on how to traverse a situation.\n\nThe game is obviously old and you'll notice parts that are rough around the edges, most notably when interacting with ropes, the grapple hook, physics interactions, and the AI. My biggest issue was the boss fight. After fighting your way to the end, the boss fight is laughably easy and kind of boring.\n\n[h1]Story / Plot[/h1]\nYou're playing in the perspective of Adrian Shepard, a US Marine Corporal who's assigned to the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit. You don't receive the full briefing of your upcoming mission and end up running through Black Mesa during the infamous incident started by Gordon Freeman from Half-Life.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't translate to the story very well, as it's as simple as, \"Adrian fights his way out of Black Mesa.\" You'll see plenty of easter eggs and nods to the first Half-Life to help indicate the timeline of events. Otherwise, there's not much to say about this game for the story. You'll be playing Half-Life: Opposing Force for the gameplay more than anything. If you're not interested in more Half-Life gameplay as much as more story, I suggest just looking up a synopsis on YouTube.\n\n[h1]Graphics / Audio[/h1]\nFor a game initially released in 1999, it's understandable that the graphics and audio aren't going to hold up to standards found in 2020. With that aside, the graphics are still quite interesting as they were in Half-Life. I did find it pretty obvious as to which assets were added in Half-Life: Opposing Force, because they had a different feel about them that didn't quite match Half-Life in some ways. The graphics overall hold a fantastic grungy sci-fi aesthetic and work perfectly for the game.\n\nThe audio is... not good. It absolutely doesn't hold up in any way. The sounds are definitely nostalgic and worked well for the time, but the voices sound strangely robotic and the guns are obnoxious. There's also a moment towards the end in a storage facility where boxes are moving on a rail, and the sound gets so loud that all other sounds distorted unpleasantly. Audio isn't the strong suit in this game, or any of the original Half-Life games.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nPick this game up if you really enjoyed the gameplay found in Half-Life. If you're looking for additional story material, there's not much here that warrants the playtime. Expect the old age of this game to provide some rough moments, but take time to appreciate the craft of the past. Half-Life was no easy feat, and even today, it still shows.\n\n[h1]Please Rate This Review[/h1]\nI spend a lot of time breaking down game design and development from a critical consumer's perspective.

This game has a story of course, but it's a progression is a lot more focused on harder combat, a lot more platforming and a lot more utilising of NPCs; it's less lever turning or sequence solving than what there was in Halflife 1. It's a different experience, but it still feels like Halflife 1 and is still fun to play, Corporal Shepherd is also a cool character and he has some pretty cool interactions Gordon Freeman never managed to have. The stories of Halflife 1 and Opposing Force aren't just completely isolated either, there's plenty of brilliant crossovers between both.\n\nI will say, however, that while the ending was cool, the final sort of \"hurdle\" was kind of easy, even on a hard difficulty, but the rest of the game can be very hard, more so than the first as there is a lot less handholding as it expects the player to already to be accustomed to Halflife.", "timestamp_created": 1586123498, "timestamp_updated": 1586123649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515202701091766357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "66697959": {"recommendationid": "66697959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198421903105", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 405, "last_played": 1585991170}, "language": "english", "review": "You spend the whole game at 40 health.", "timestamp_created": 1586115778, "timestamp_updated": 1586115778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "66694925": {"recommendationid": "66694925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159661280", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 341, "last_played": 1586114622}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, great story!

There are also interesting new weapon concepts. Also the boot camp tutorial is extremely well done, and it's probably the highlight of the game.\n\nUnfortunately for the expansion, all the new concepts are very poorly integrated. For example, climbable ropes appear maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire game. In another case, 2 new types of suit rechargers are teased in the tutorial, military and civilian, and I only saw the military recharger once (I didn't find a single civilian recharger).\n\nHealth and suit power pickups are very scarce, and you are often thrown into hordes of enemies. There's one section where you're in a pitch-black maze and are meant to face off against many miniboss-tier enemies, with no ammo or health pickups. On the very last level, you face off against hordes of black-ops, at which point i turned on noclip and godmode because I was tired of this.\n\nAt one point, multiple new weapons are introduced very close to each other, with little instructions on how to use them, so I finished the game with about 3 weapons I ended up never using. \n\nThese complaints are just a very small slice of annoyances I had with the expansion. However, I don't feel like writing, so I'll stop here.\n\nBlue shift is a much better expansion, go play that instead.", "timestamp_created": 1585331067, "timestamp_updated": 1590357360, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469616830348968506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "65946367": {"recommendationid": "65946367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120660427", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 278, "last_played": 1585327202}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended if you appreciate the other Half life games, just watch out for bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1585327255, "timestamp_updated": 1585327255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "65936212": {"recommendationid": "65936212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031420026", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 662, "last_played": 1585321998}, "language": "english", "review": "best expansion  package ever\n", "timestamp_created": 1585318019, "timestamp_updated": 1585318019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "65923097": {"recommendationid": "65923097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169316021", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1585304754}, "language": "english", "review": "A rather enjoyable expansion, Half Life: Opposing force takes a different and rather enjoyable route than the base storyline playing as one of the 'factions' Gordon is tasked up against fighting out of Black Mesa.

I should also mention that I enjoyed the final boss of Opposing Force just as much as -if not more than- Nihilanth. All in all, this is a must-play for Half-life fans, or anyone looking for a good time.

The game has unfortunately aged abysmally. Originally, I had thought that my issues were coming from the fact that I was playing on Hard mode. Lord knows \"Hard\" meant something different in the 90s than it does now, but the further in I went, the more I realized that it wasn't me, it was the game. Weapons that I had picked up and appeared in my hotbar failed to actually register as weapons I had. This was a major problem for several portions of the game, as my rocket launcher, xen portal gun, and machine gun were all effectively missing from my inventory despite the fact that I had them and ammo for them. The second major issue I had was an unavoidable crash near the end of the game. In the parking garage, I would crash every single time I attempted to turn a corner down a ramp, effectively forcing me to use cheats just to finish the game.\nNext off, the gameplay itself, while being Half-Lifey, is honestly broken in its own right. Enemies appear to be able to damage the player more than the player can damage them with the same weapon when playing on Hard mode. I know I'm going to be told to just \"get good\" over this, but a fundamental element of singleplayer, story driven games is that the player feels like their in control. Sure, for things like giant aliens, I can see the reasoning behind why I'm not stronger than them, but Adrian Shephard isn't supposed to be a regular soldier, either, he's supposed to be a Corporal that's equipped with a new, experimental suit of armor akin to the soldier version of the HEV suit. Attacks from Shock Troopers take a minimum of 10 hp off Adrian if he doesn't have any suit power, and believe me, suit power is few and far between in this game. Things like the rope gameplay and use of a night vision instead of flashlight seem arbitrary and unnecessary to me. The rope gameplay itself seems to fail to do its job properly in every place it's in during gameplay, especially during the final boss. Night Vision, on the other hand, is weak and doesn't go out far enough for the player to see in some dark areas of the game where it's an absolute necessity.\n\n\n[h1] SPOILERS FOR THE STORY BELOW [/h1] \n\nOpposing Force sees you as Corporal Adrian Shephard, an HECU Commander equipped with an experimental Military vest called the \"PCV\" or \"Powered Combat Vest.\" Shephard and his squad are brought in early on during the Black Mesa incident, but Shephard is knocked out after their heli crashes. Because of this, you witness the end of Half-Life early on in the campaign, and see what happens after Gordon has already defeated the Nihilinth afterwards. After initial containment by the HECU is deemed a failure, the black ops are brought in to take out everyone through the use of a warhead. Shephard disarms the warhead, but it later detonates after the end of the game anyway. After fighting through hoards of Race X aliens and Black ops, Shephard finds himself in the depths of the industrial section of Black Mesa. Here, he encounters the Gene Worm, a giant Race X alien capable of processing and converting the entire planet into a habitat fit for Race X. Shephard kills it and is captured by the Gman, who keeps him in stasis, leaving the player to wonder what might happen to him next.\n\nThe story and gameplay tell a very different tale than that of Half-Life. You're not a super scientist saving the world in a big orange suit, you're a soldier on the losing side of a war fighting desperately to survive, knowing that the only way to win is to sacrifice Black Mesa and everyone in it. Opposing Force feels a lot like the Halo Reach of Half-Life. You don't feel anywhere near as Strong as Gordon Freeman, and you have to abandon and sacrifice your own squad members throughout the campaign just to keep going. With Opposing Force starting near the end of Half-Life, you can get a proper perspective of what's going on with the invasion outside of Gordon Freeman's point of view, and just how much damage is being dealt to the whole world. By the time you're fighting the gene worm, you don't feel like a hero, you feel like a tired soldier moments away from falling apart, just wanting it all to be over with. When the game ends, after the credit sequence, you aren't booted out into the main menu, you're given a black screen with the low whistling of wind, continuing on into eternity. The game's story is poetic, it puts you in the shoes of a member of the bad guys suffering the same fate as the good guys, and ends with an immense loss, especially considering what happens to humanity next. One can argue that Gordon Freeman's battle in Half-Life is the same, struggling to fight the oncoming invasion and somewhat losing at the end, but in Half-Life, you know what you did saved the world from the Xen invasion, whereas in Opposing Force, you don't have any orders being given to you by scientists or commanders, you're a lost soldier just doing what he can do to survive.\n\nSTORY SPOILERS END HERE.\n\nWith a story like that, usually I could give a raving 5 star review, but the gameplay is just too broken in the modern day for me to grace it with such. I would say \"I hope Valve or Gearbox go back to fix these\" but we both know they won't. It's 2020.

I mean, officially authorized third-party expansions are rarely good. But what we have here? It's a pretty neat exception. Sure, [b]Gearbox[/b] (yes, the same [b]Gearbox[/b], which co-founder calls [b]Steam[/b] \u201c[i]dying store[/i]\u201d nowadays) didn't make the [b]Opposing Force[/b] from scratch, but they also didn't just give us more of the same. They seriously tried to create a new experience. And succeeded. A lot.\n\nThe idea to let us see the original [b]Half-Life[/b] events from a different point of view alone was kind of brilliant. In [b]Opposing Force[/b] we're playing as [b]Adrian Shephard[/b], a young US Marine Corporal, who was just assigned to the [b]Hazardous Environment Combat Unit[/b] from the [b]Santego Military Base[/b]. In other words, we'll control one of those guys who tried to hunt down [b]Gordon Freeman[/b] for more than a half of the original [b]Half-Life[/b] (that's a lot of halves for one sentence, huh?). We'll do the proper military training, we'll learn more about how things work between the marines and the [b]Black Ops[/b], we'll see how some orders from the original [b]Half-Life[/b] were given (\u201c[i]Forget about [b]Freeman[/b][/i]!\u201d), we'll actually see some events from the original game as different character, etc, etc, etc. Even though there won't be any choice at the end of this expansion, it's still a pretty neat stuff for all [b]Half-Life[/b] fans.\n\nAnd gameplay-wise? It's also pretty cool. Sure, level design became a little bit more dumb, but it's not nearly as dumb as in some other games [b]Gearbox[/b] will produce after this, and it's also less rough than in the original game. Which is a good thing, since some parts in [b]Valve[/b]'s game were just... [i]UGH![/i] It's kind of sad that the best parts of level design here are copy / pasted from [b]Valve[/b]'s work, but still, I can't say that levels in the [b]Opposing Force[/b] are bad. Quite the opposite, most of the time I totally enjoyed them.\n\nThe best thing about gameplay, though, is that there's heck of a lot of the new features here. [b]Gearbox[/b] didn't just change the point of view, they gave us the proper military experience here. We've got quite a lot of new weapons (from regular ones, like sniper rifle and combat knife, to alien), we've got laser sight, we've got the ability to use ropes, we've got night vision, we've got medics and engineers to command (medics can heal both you and nearby [b]NPC[/b]s, while engineers will help you to force open closed doors) and, the best of all, we'll be able to use [b]Barnacle[/b] (one of those things that live on ceilings) as a tool. Remember hookshot from [b]The Legend of Zelda[/b] games? That's pretty much what we've got here. For real. [b]Gearbox[/b] literally added the hookshot to [b]Half-Life[/b]. [i]BOOM![/i] Mind blown.\n\nSo, yes, I do recommend this expansion and I do hope it'll get more attention nowadays. I mean, come on! The original [b]Half-Life[/b] still has a life (now it's a sentence with too much \u201clife\u201d...). It got [b]Source[/b] remaster, it got awesome remake called [b]Black Mesa[/b] (go check it out), etc, etc, etc. But [b]Gerbox[/b]'s expansions? Those just stayed in the past. Even though there's a lot of great and unique stuff in them. The [b]Opposing Force[/b] is more than just the expansion. It's a whole new experience. And it doesn't deserve becoming obsolete. [b]21[/b] year later, I totally enjoyed re-playing it. Hope you'll do to.

You will interact with the scientists and other HECU units to help you along the way as they assist you in progressing through the game. You get to do a few extra things in this game, such as climb and swing from ropes, get some new weapons, and you'll listen into HECU radios that will inform you about your mission and the progress of the alien invasion.\n\nThe visuals seem to run off the same engine as the original Half-Life (not surprising) as well as many of the audio tracks and sound effects are very nostalgic.\n\nI like how Valve was able to give us a different viewpoint of the alien invasion from Half-Life, but change it up from the original game. I think this game does a good job of portraying what the HECU would've been doing during the alien invasion at Black Mesa and they did it pretty well. The only underwhelming thing I think this game suffers from is the final boss, which isn't very difficult once you get the rhythm down (like most games).

One aspect of Op For that I really appreciated was that my expectations of the game's objectives were subverted considerably in a way that makes the HECU almost sympathetic. \nGameplay is very much familiar with only the new methods of getting around levels - namely rope climbing and using the Barnacles to pull you across - being the newest learning curve but both are pretty straightforward. The new weapons are pretty good and as with Half-Life titles, you have to be strategic with the weapons you use as ammo is pretty scarce though you can use the Displacer Cannon to transport to Xen to find new ammo for most weapon types though you need a large quantity of depleted uranium ammo in the first place to make the transport. Building a squad in the game with other HECU marines is a really nice feature (revolutionary when Op For was first released) where you can order more heavily armed marines with the SAW to cover you while the medics could help give a health boost out on the field and engineers can cut through doors. Sometimes they're not essential but there are occasions where it is not possible to progress throughout the game without their help so it is in your best interests to keep safeguard your squad.\nIn terms of the new Race X aliens, you often have to take a stance using cover and strafing much more than other Half-Life titles as the Shock Troopers have significant offensive strength and the Pit Drones have strength in numbers whilst the Voltigores are ammo sponges that can be deadly in close quarters, where you will often find them.\nAs much as I enjoyed Blue Shift, Op For is by far the better game to me, also helped by the latter taking a couple of hours longer to complete in addition to the new content available whilst the former is more about creating exposition that sets up Half-Life 2. The biggest criticism I have of Op For is an unresolved bug where you become stuck in position, most frequently so when you travel down an elevator, only being able to look around and forcing you to reload from a point before you got in the elevator. The only resolution I've found is to keep jumping in the elevator until it stops moving so you don't get stuck.\n", "timestamp_created": 1583071993, "timestamp_updated": 1583071993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64286324": {"recommendationid": "64286324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314684372", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 234, "last_played": 1591842180}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game", "timestamp_created": 1582967269, "timestamp_updated": 1582967269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "64270187": {"recommendationid": "64270187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134859187", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 252, "last_played": 1582939072}, "language": "english", "review": "This expansion for Half-Life is actually pretty good, At this time of reviewing this.

But Opposing Force has very little if not zero frustrating parts, and is overall much more enjoyable.\n\nOpposing Force is incredibly immersive, and I actually felt the tension and connection to our silent protagonist the whole time. I think the story here is told in a much better way than the base game, but to properly enjoy it, you must have played the original game first.\n\nWell, there's not much to say here, it's more Half-Life, with less frustrating bits and more refined good parts.

Life.\n\nThis time, you will embark on the adventures of Corporal [u]Adrian Shepard[/u], a brave soldier from the American military, who, initially charged with capturing Gordon Freeman, will find himself having to cancel the mission and do the only more sensible thing: run away from Black Mesa at all costs!\nWith the help of the survivors of Black Mesa and his military companions, he will face the looming alien threat and the mysterious \"agents in black\", who also seem willing to hunt Gordon Freeman and eliminate anyone who dares to escape from Black Mesa.\n\nThe game proves much longer and richer in content (in fact you will be able to use many military weapons including the Desert Eagle which is a variant of the revolver, the LMG, the sniper rifle, the C4, the anti-personnel mine with laser sensor, the rocket-launcher with laser aiming system to guide missiles and even alien weapons, very useful when you run out of ammunition) and full of action compared to Half Life: Blue Shift (there are many types of aliens and zombies to face and there are the agents in black who are very tough).\n\nThe story may be trivial, but actually, like Half Life: Blue Shift, the game is another important part of the Half Life story.\nIn fact, through Shepard's eyes, you will be able to discover some parts of the Half Life story (for example the powerful explosion in Black Mesa, which occurred because of a bomb brought by the agents in black and tampered with by the mysterious Gman).\nWell yes, even in this game you will be able to meet Gman for more than once, who will sometimes try to help you and in other times he will try to stop you.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this game is the possibility of interacting with the characters, especially with the military companions, who will give you support by fighting alongside you (there are the engineer who, equipped with the blowtorch, can open any armored door and the doctor who will provide you with medical treatment).\nThe problem is their intelligence which is a little bad (they tend to disperse without reason and at some point they don't follow you, as if they don't see you anymore).\n\nThe game is a lot of fun because it gives you the impression of fulfilling a real military mission and acting like a soldier and above all there are some bosses to be eliminated.\n\nI highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created":

The story is fantastic, showing a different perspective.\n\nThere are a few new weapons (alien lightning gun, Desert Eagle) and some new features.

You learn to climb ropes and at one point you can use alien technology of grappling gun.\n\nGraphics is not great, but it's cool enough and the level design with brilliant color schemes and lighting styles makes up for it.\n\nOverall, this game is a splendid masterpiece and I would recommend anyone buying.", "timestamp_created": 1578174313, "timestamp_updated": 1578174358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61301855": {"recommendationid": "61301855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198868482656", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 548, "last_played": 1580897181}, "language": "english", "review": "The Best Classic Game of the Classics", "timestamp_created": 1578162147, "timestamp_updated": 1578162147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61226761": {"recommendationid": "61226761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198875044568", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 202, "last_played": 1586839422}, "language": "english", "review": "yes\n", "timestamp_created": 1578072793, "timestamp_updated": 1578072793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61223274": {"recommendationid": "61223274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198880503955", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 237, "last_played": 1588893147}, "language": "english", "review": "goodddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd", "timestamp_created": 1578069293, "timestamp_updated": 1578069293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61189749": {"recommendationid": "61189749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162308867", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 193, "last_played": 1595181111}, "language": "english", "review": "very very awesome game very retro very nostalgic to those have played it before like me i have played and beaten this game so many times it amazes me that they updated the graphics so much very good game", "timestamp_created": 1578026625, "timestamp_updated": 1578026625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61184851": {"recommendationid": "61184851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097645403", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3014, "last_played": 1578020738}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty good would recommend :)", "timestamp_created": 1578019678, "timestamp_updated": 1578019678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "61178796": {"recommendationid": "61178796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267193694", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 516, "last_played": 1578010967}, "language": "english", "review": "its pretty good, like a Half Life 2 before Half Life 2.

OPFOR) unlike blueshift, is actually really good. Out of Half Life and it's expansions Opposing Force has by far been my favorite for the new mechanics and enemies that have been added. My main complaints are that the Xen Aliens essentially (or more correctly the tough ones. IE: alien grunts, and vorts) cease to exist past the early part of the game.

For a product made by an entirely different studio, it was still a great experience, although obviously not on par with the original's groundbreaking journey. There are times where it will feel like the four hours it takes to beat the game is wearing thin, but this is usually not the case, as most of the time you will have an action-packed adventure pushing you to forward and excited to see more of what it has to offer. Some battles feel uninspired or ridiculous in the sense that it pits you against multiple incredibly difficult enemies at a time in an attempt to escape the responsibility of creating actually quality fights, but there are more fun battles than not, so it isn't a major issue. A great addition that helps the game feel fresh is the addition of many new enemies, weapons, and character skins. When there are a limited variety of skins for the various non-playable characters you meet, the immersion can kind of be broken, but \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\"makes sure to add plenty into the mix to avoid that.\n\nThe gameplay here is just as great as the original, it feels like an additional side story to the pre-existing game, but with fun, creative changes in certain functions of the world that make for more dynamic gameplay, even if some feel more like gimmicks added just to say they added something new. Nonetheless, this does add a lot to keep it fresh for the few hour run it demands from you, although I found myself playing for about thirty minutes to an hour at most at a time until completing it instead of long stretches of gameplay like for the original, which in comparison would have me glued to the computer for hours just enthralled with what I was playing. This is one of the main differences in quality that puts \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" those couple of levels below the original, the replayability here feels much more slim, so there is no doubt I'm more likely to go back and play through \"Half-Life\" again rather than this expansion pack. This is not to knock the overall experience, just to put a wedge between them quality-wise. \n\nWith all that said, \"Half-Life: Opposing Force\" is still an excellent experience. Many of the fantastic gameplay mechanics that made the original so great are still here, and you can tell the developers tried their best to live up to Valve's original masterpiece, and the love present here is felt, even if it doesn't hit that almost unreachable mark \"Half-Life\" set. If you are a \"Half-Life\" fan, this is an expansion pack you can't go wrong with, as it pumps a breath of fresh air back into the critically acclaimed series and takes a different approach and gives a alternate perspective on the events at Black Mesa.\n\n[RATING: 7.9/10]", "timestamp_created": 1576122037, "timestamp_updated": 1599210403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50205761194229126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59691562": {"recommendationid": "59691562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293069552", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1575526306}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game, and i love the characters Including the main character Adrian Shephard, i just wish there was more games about him for all we know he is still in stasis doing Nothing at all", "timestamp_created": 1576117453, "timestamp_updated": 1576117453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59684424": {"recommendationid": "59684424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963156312", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1629, "last_played": 1576360308}, "language": "english", "review": "is gud", "timestamp_created": 1576104405, "timestamp_updated": 1576104405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59671423": {"recommendationid": "59671423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122576597", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 328, "last_played": 1579961584}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun\n", "timestamp_created": 1576086000, "timestamp_updated": 1576086000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59659964": {"recommendationid": "59659964", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995276300", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1575898715}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a classic.

By taking control of Andrew Shepard, a member of the military group sent in to kill Gordan Freeman, you get to see the game's original story from a different angle. The level design is improved, the arsenal of weaponry is refined and expanded, and there are new enemies to fight along the way, culminating in a successful expansion of the Half-Life formula!\n\nThe levels in [b] Half Life: Opposing Force [/b] provide new sections of the Black Mesa research facility to play through. These areas include new tram levels, sewer levels, and even more encounters with the Pit Monster from the original title.  The jumps and landscape are smoothed a bit better, leading to less instances of falling to your death or getting caught on the environment and staying stuck (although it still happened multiple times). While buggy, the levels look interesting, and play just as well as the original titles.\n\nThere are also new additions to Shepard's arsenal, such as an LMG, Transporter gun, Electric Shock Rifle, Heavy Pistol, and a grappling hook. This adds new ways to approach combat, as well as get around the environment, something that still occurred in the base game but at a much less frequent rate. Enemies also pack these weapons as well, so the ability to take and deal a lot of damage is enticing.\n\nLastly, new enemy types are introduced. All seem to be dangerous, ranging from Shock Troopers to Voltigores, to even an encounter with a helicopter like in the base game. These enemies introduce a new level of difficulty to the title, and cause the player to have to approach each section with care and awareness. I did feel that some sections of the game where multiple Voltigores would spawn were a too difficult, but I have to give Gearbox credit for adding something different to the Half-Life experience.\n\nAll in all, this was a fun expansion to play through, and I [b] Recommend [/b] it to any fans of the original game or FPS games in general. There was enough new content, enemies, and locations to run through, despite it still being a retelling of the base game from a different perspective a la [b] Half Life: Blue Shift [/b].

An expansion for the already revolutionary Half-Life following a new protagonist, Adrian Shepherd. Opposing Force introduces new gameplay elements such as new weapons, a grappling hook, squad interactions which was later inplemented to Half-Life 2, etc. Story was a focus on the marines' perspective during the events of Half-Life. Also got more hints and story to the mysterious G-man in the last game. Definitely a must play if you enjoyed the original Half Life.\n\nSome annoying issues with the game is the glitches, dated AI, and crashes, but we can all ignore that. \n\nThanks to Half-Life Opposing force, it helped kickstarted Gearbox Software that later gave us Borderlands Series but sadly, Borderlands and a few other titles were really excellent games and other titles such as Duke Nukem Forever, Aliens: Colonel Marines, Battleborn were quite crappy.  Finally Valve is taking development to Half-Life: Alyx which hopefully would bring Half-Life series back from the dead, and hopefully we could see a future story with Adrian Shepherd.\n\n\nEdit

Adrian and his squad catch a helicopter ride to the testing facility, but are attacked by alien ships. After crash landing inside Black Mesa, the marine wakes up to a scientist giving him CPR. However, Adrian knows his mission is to eliminate anyone who knows about the alien invasion.

This game is very similar to the first Halflife and the story happens paralel to the story of Halflife but with another character.

Like Halflife, there is no mission tracking or mini map, so if you save your process and play again next day you may not remember what to do next. So listen carefully to the NPCs, they tell you what to do.\n\nIn overall if you have played Halflife and liked it, then you must play this game also. It was first supposed to be an addon but now its like a standalone addon, dont need Halflife to be installed to play it.\n\nLike Halflife it supports Full HD resolution 1920x1080. I played on windows 10 with i5 and GTX 1060. Some minor glitches and bugs but not disturbing. I had 2 or 3 crashes without error closed to the end of the game. It was when walking to a new area, then Halflife needs 2-3 seconds to load the new area and game freezes for a short time.

Opposing Force is one of these. It introduces the greatest character in all of Half-Life... Adrian Shephard. The Opposing Force also adds changes a few things. As you may imagine at the end of the game you have different weapons than you'd have if you played OG Half-Life. It creates new interesting opportunities to make this experience unique and not only a repetition of the same as in one other expansion.\nThe marks I give in this review are mine and mine alone. I will be granting points, from 1 to 10, according to my choice and I will try to add comments whenever neccessary.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Criterion[/th]\n[th]Mark[/th]\n[th]Comments[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Story[/th]\n[th]8/10[/th]\n[th]The same events as in Half-Life although seen from another perspective[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Audio[/th]\n[th]8.5/10[/th]\n[th]It goes well with what's going on-screen[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Visual representation[/th]\n[th]5/10[/th]\n[th]In 2019 it shows the age[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Gameplay[/th]\n[th]10/10[/th]\n[th]First person shooting in its prime, puzzles not too hard[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[th]Controls[/th]\n[th]9/10[/th]\n[th]Would be 10/10 if not for the crouch jump, Ctrl+Space is not intuitive, changing crouching key to key of choice makes it more bearable[/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b][u] Important notes [/u][/b]\nIf you finished this expansion and want more I recommend playing through another official expansion for Half-Life that was not released on PC. It is named [i] Decay [/i]. Thanks to the gracious Half-Life modding community all PC users can experience this expansion in full glory.

There are new mechanics, such as the ability to control specialized Marines that can open doors and heal you. There is also (awful) rope physics! Multiplayer was introduced in this expansion, but I have never played it so I can't speak for it.\nThe graphics, sound, AI, voice acting, controls, and general design of the game are exactly the same as the original Half-Life.\n\nPlay this if you want to see a side story set during the Resonance Cascade. And don't skip the boot camp!

Personally, I didn't like the OG Half-Life TOO much, from the BS cheap enemy spawns and the overreliance on bad first person platforming that makes the player save scum whether they want to or not. Is all that still in this expansion campaign? Yes, but lessened, and the campaign is shorter so it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nI also found the weapon selection, while only SLIGHTLY varied from the first one, is an improvement. The special ops handgun that replaces the magnum in the original is great, the .50 cal (I think it's an FAL, not sure though) rules, and the alien guns, I thought, were way more useful. \n\nThere's also more of a focus in this game on using survivors that you find and keeping them alive to help you out and use them in contextual situations than the first one, and I think that works well here. \n\nThe only down side was that there were some tech problems getting this one up and running, as it wouldn't open properly and Steam seemed to think that the game was running when it was not. So I had to restart my computer, open the game, close hl.exe in my task manager, have Steam verify the files, THEN open the game again and it would work. Luckily, I was able to beat the game in 3 separate sessions, so I could uninstall this one quick, haha. Yeah, maybe it was just a computer problem locally, but I haven't had that problem with any other game on my Steam library, except for a slightly similar problem with Hitman Blood Money. Strange, be on the lookout for problems with this one. Some troubleshooting may be required.\n\nThe plot is also pretty cool, as they did a good job having it overlap with the original game, where the first 2/3rds of this game take place over the second half of the original, but from a separate perspective, humanizing the military a little more where in the OG they were just 100% evil and unsympathetic. You also get to see that Freeman wasn't the ONLY person the G-Man was utilizing to fulfill his ends.\n\nAll in all, where the OG Half-Life left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth over the more aggravating aspects and flaws of the game that really built up near the end half, I didn't have as much of a problem with this one, as they had figured it out a little bit more and were just throwing together a short side campaign, and I thought it worked.\n\nIf you just care about the plot of Half-Life and the origins of Freeman, you're better off just playing the first one and then moving on to the second one, but if you just want to see what the gameplay of the original is like but want less frustrations, or if you REALLY liked the OG and want more of it, then try this one. It's less than $1 on sale, and if you bought the original Half-Life in a cheap pack on sale, then you already own this one.", "timestamp_created": 1563622731, "timestamp_updated": 1563623121, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506625115871429443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54189753": {"recommendationid": "54189753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103175440", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 20, "last_played": 1545734657}, "language": "english", "review": "A short version but still a lovely side story.", "timestamp_created": 1563600466, "timestamp_updated": 1563600466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54188801": {"recommendationid": "54188801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198881966687", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 187, "last_played": 1569036974}, "language": "english", "review": "best half life expansion pack", "timestamp_created": 1563594005, "timestamp_updated": 1563594005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54188661": {"recommendationid": "54188661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240380374", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1710, "last_played": 1576306213}, "language": "english", "review": "Best half life YET!!!!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1563593067, "timestamp_updated": 1563593067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54184429": {"recommendationid": "54184429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379053115", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 242, "last_played": 1583868093}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1563567581, "timestamp_updated": 1564609009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548436880111694336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "54181315": {"recommendationid": "54181315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239080592", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 74, "last_played": 1590276605}, "language": "english", "review": "A great expansion pack or DLC (they weren't that mainstream as of now) for the original Game of The Year Award winning Half-Life!\n\nThis time, you play as a marine named \"Adrian Shepherd\".

That said, I was expecting something else. I've experienced many FPS games in these years, I've seen it all. But the Half-Life expansions have really missed my library, until this recent summer sale when I purchased the Valve Complete Pack.\n\n[h1] The Best Half-Life there is [/h1]\n\nFor some, that may be an overstatement, but hear me out. I've now played ALL the half-life games. HL1, HL2, Blue Shift, Opposing Force, Decay (PS2) and even Uplink (the demo to HL1). But Opposing Force did something better than the others, it gave this series a true personality. \n\nLet me explain:\n\nSo the game is played from the perspective on Cpl. Adrian Shepard, a HECU Marine sent to investigate the Black Mesa incident once a phenomenon know as a \"resonance cascade\" allowed for a sudden alien invasion. The unit that Shepard is sent with is kinda late, as the game begins sometime after the chapter \"Surface Tension\" in Half-Life. The story connects instantly, as one of the Apache helicopter that accompanies Shepard's squad flies off to intercept Gordon Freeman, who is now outside and \"on the loose\" trying to fight his way to the Lambda Complex. Shortly after, your helicopter gets shot down and the fight immediately begins to erupt. Marines vs Aliens, all-out-war.\n\nYou wake up after an unknown amount of time, sometime before the beginning of \"Forget about Freeman\". The story becomes no longer after investigating the attack, but getting out of the facility. The situation is out of control, everyone runs for their lives, including the marines.\n\nFrom here on out, from the order to \"get out\" and all the way until the ending, you must fight through Black Mesa with you military skills and some other help. This \"help\" comes in the form of your fellow marine friends, who will assist you in combat. There are a couple of classes that can help you. The Medic (who heals you), the engineer (who opens doors for you) and the heavy weapons guy (a dude with an LMG who kills everything in his path). There are also some generic soldiers like the gas mask guy and the lieutenant, who are both useless in combat, but I'll touch on that later.\n\nThe way that this expansion is the definitive Half-Life experience is due to the addition of many more things that weren't present on Half-Life. New aliens (a giant tank-like alien, a creature that shoots some sort of electrical weapon, and a smaller creature with claws that can leap to you and kill you in a couple of hits), new weapons (LMG, Sniper, Deagle, some sort of fish that instakills anything, a barnacle that can be used to attach to walls and climb unreachable aliens, and a launcher that can teleport you or other creatures to Xen), and also cool new bosses like a giant worm-like creature and the final one, which is a colossal amalgamation between all other aliens (i think). All of this is topped by the Black Ops soldiers, your sworn enemies, who are even deadlier than in the original game. There are multiple types of Black Ops, from the regular ninjas to the Black Ops soldiers, who are heavily armored, take longer to kill and can easily flank you and kill you if you're not strategic enough.\n\nThe puzzle mechanics of Half-Life have been reduced a bit, there's way less platforming and instead the expansion focuses more on combat rather than just jumping through levels, but the supplement of new enemies and weapons provides for a much more fun experience. All of the action sequences are really well done, you always feel on the edge, running and dodging bullets from the Black Ops, and outsmarting the aliens at every step. You will feel accomplished, overwhelmed, a bit tired, but that's what Black Mesa does to you, I guess.\n\nMany themes are picked up in Opposing Force, and your main objective of investigating the attack (you never got the order to silence the witnesses, so killing scientists is not one of your priorities, neither is Freeman, since the order was to \"forget about freeman\") suddenly become about escaping the facility, later about disarming the nuke that the Black Ops set up in order to end the facilty once and for all, and at the end, you're supposed to finish off the \"nastiest thing yet\", the final boss in order to escape Black Mesa and aid in saving the world (although Mr.Freeman did that already, I guess).\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nSo did Opposing Force live up to my expectations?

I already had 2 and all the episodes for Garry's Mod but I felt like since I was just done with one of the games from the Cascade Resonance saga, I had to play another one. That's when I saw Opposing Force, on sale for mere 29 rubles. To say that that wasn't enough to make me buy it would be to lie. Few minutes later, I was already playing it. Hour after hour, it was completed. And then completed again. And again. So I moved on to the rest of the series, but after completing the rest, I felt like Shephard's story needed to be continued.

And like the first half life, this game succeed as well.\n\nThis game set in the area of time after Gordon freeman opened the portals to the aliens the enter to earth, and lets you see the story from a different point of view, as for the point of view of the US marines who came to destroy every sign of black mesa\u2019s existence after the big incident.\n\nIn the game you play as admiral Shepard, a soldier which is part of the US marine, who came to destroy black mesa after the big incident, but his squad\u2019s helicopter crashed, and he was left alone to try and get out of black mesa, with the goal of killing Gordon freeman in the way, but also to keep himself alive as much as he can.\n\nThe story of the new game is great and shows the reasons why the first half life was a great success, featuring great new levels with enemies and bosses to fight, and with new puzzle to think through like the first half life did.\n  \nThrough the story you will encounter some new types of enemies and bosses that weren\u2019t present in the first game, and get to use new sets of weapons, which a lot of them are fun to use. With that, because in this game you play as part of the US marines and not against them, like in the first half life, you get to regroup with soldier teammates that will help you to fight the aliens, and unlike the guards in the first half life, those US marines hold with them heavy and more damaging weapons like the SMG from the first half life, shotguns and even machine guns, while the guards in the first half life used only pistols, and could insist less amount of damage with that. Another new mechanic that wasn\u2019t in the first half life and got added to this game is the ability to climb up ropes. Even know it fresh the mechanic of the game, I found it being more annoying then helpful in most situations, because of how similar it is to an enemy alien that will grab you up to kill you.\n\nWhile the game was very fun, and keeps itself as quality as the first game in the series, the game still lacks consistency with the main character\u2019s morals and goals. Because in the game I play as admiral Shepard, and his goals is to destroy black mesa, I should not help scientists and guards lives in my journey to escape black mesa, and instead arrest them or kill them instead of helping them so they would help me escape by opening locked doors like in the first half life. Another flaw in the game for me is that throughout the game you get to use more and more experimental and alien weapons, instead of more weapons that used in the US army. While those flaws minor, and doesn\u2019t destroy the experience the first half life was known for, those still effect my thoughts about the story\u2019s main character, Shepard, to see him less as a soldier that came to destroy the place, and more like another Gordon freeman. \n\nAnother problem I faced is with the game\u2019s mouse movement, which unlike the small story flaws I wrote before, this mouse movement problem is a big issue. the problem is that sometimes the crosshairs gets bugged when you move it, making it horrible to aim, and would make you sometimes get stuck for a long period of time on the same part of the level just because the crosshair gets bugged all the time and you can\u2019t aim at the enemy because of it.

This time you aren't playing as a scientist trying to escape the facility, you're playing as one of the soldiers sent in to handle the situation. It's Half-Life with some new bits and pieces, new maps, and a new story, so I'll just talk about the new additions and changes. Like the original game, the story serves as an excuse for the gameplay. You play as Corporal Adrian Shephard, generic mute action protagonist military man, on his journey to survive and save as many people as possible. The story is a nice spin on the original plot, where you get put in the shoes of a generic enemy soldier from the first game. It gives some insight on why the soldiers start killing innocents and have an obsession with killing Freeman, but more could be done with it. Overall the story is good and provides a fun change of pace from the first game. The gameplay is still as fun as it was in the first game, with some new features such as the tentacle grapple and rope climbing. While they are fun to use, the new features often get put to the sidelines for so long that you forget they exist, so when the odd section comes along expecting you to use them, you might get confused and lost before figuring out what you're supposed to do. One feature that sounds fun on paper, but gets more tedious in practice is the inclusion of squad gameplay. Shephard can command a different soldiers to follow him around and help in combat, with different classes offering different advantages. It's fun at first, but later on it gets annoying as the ally soldier AI tends to get in the way, get into firefights with each other, act dumb and get killed, or act dumb and get you killed. It's a neat concept that I overall enjoy, but it's heavily hindered by poor AI. The new guns added to the game are fun, and I found myself enjoying coming up with tactics for when and how to use each one. Like the first game, ammo is scarce enough to enforce strategy, but lets you enjoy using all the different weapons without feeling too limited. The new levels are all great additions. There are firefights with enemy black ops soldiers that feel tense, firefights with aliens that provide different experiences based on alien types, chaotic war zones that are a gigantic cluster of violence and death, and puzzle sections that add a nice break in the gameplay. There's even some horror elements in some of the levels, with darkness being used to create a tense atmosphere where you never really feel safe. I actually like the level design in Opposing Force more than the original Half-Life levels, which is high praise considering I loved the Half-Life stages. The only level that's really a downer for me is the final boss battle, which feels very anti-climactic, especially when compared to the original Half-Life's final boss. The new enemies are also cool and fun to play against, with each of them adding a challenge to overcome that never feels unfair.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Same great Half-Life gameplay\n-Story offers a neat perspective\n-Well made levels\n-New weapons are fun to use\n-The new gameplay mechanics are mostly fun\n-New enemies offer new challenges\n\nCons:\n-AI makes squad gameplay annoying\n-New gameplay additions aren't used enough\n-Anti-climactic final boss\n\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force is a great game, and if you like the original Half-Life, it's definitely worth picking up. While not every new feature and level is perfect, they offer enough variety where you'll be sure to find something enjoyable out of them. I fully recommend you give it a go if you like the Half-Life formula, or if you're just interested in a different take on the events of the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1559999673, "timestamp_updated": 1559999673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "51103131": {"recommendationid": "51103131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047366198", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 348, "last_played": 1580144441}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, it's pretty good...", "timestamp_created": 1559930869, "timestamp_updated": 1559930869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "51002633": {"recommendationid": "51002633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102332374", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 358, "last_played": 1559428948}, "language": "english", "review": "I have some pretty mixed feelings about this to be honest.

It's expansion, Opposing Force, unfortunately has these exact same flaws so it's disappointing nothing was improved upon here. The first problem is that there are several sections where the difficult spikes to an insane degree, placing you in rooms with no escape surrounded by way too many enemies, many of whom are complete bullet sponges that only serve to eat up your ammo. There were several points in the game that were just exhausting to play through, as I was constantly save scumming and searching every nook and cranny desperately for just one measly med pack. Another problem in this game, like the previous entry, is that the level design can get quite confusing at times and forces you to backtrack fairly often. This is made even worse in this game by the fact that in certain sections you have a squad that you must direct through the hallways and corridors in order to advance to the next section. I'll just say that the path-finding AI was still very primitive for it's time and these sections probably should have been skipped all together. By far the worst flaw however is the fucking platforming. My god has the platforming not aged well with these games at all. There is no weight to your character and you feel like you're floating on a pocket of air or sliding on ice pretty much the whole game. Sounds like the perfect physics system to include platforming doesn't it? I was almost driven to tears in the original Half Life due to platforming bullshit rearing its ugly head in the final boss fight. Thankfully, the final boss in this game is not nearly as hair pulling, but there are still several ugly sections that require death after death until you nail the jump just right.\n\nNow to what I enjoyed. The combat in this game is still top notch and the tension is incredibly high. There are no slow moments in this game and no chance to breathe, it's an action packed thrill ride from start to finish. I'm not sure if this is one of the first games to do the multiple perspectives on an event thing (I know Resident Evil 2 did this a year earlier), but it does it well and you really feel like complete hell and chaos is happening around you through radio broadcasts and several in game cut-scenes. The game itself starts about one hour or so before the end of the original Half Life and greatly expands on the lore of the world, adding many new weapons and enemies to keep the experience fresh. Only real complaint about the story I can come up with is that I thought the build up to the final boss was quite weak. In the original you go through a ton of shit to finally get to the creature who opened the portal in the first place and it's built up as this huge powerful entity that isn't to be fucked with.

Balance hard mode. I have no idea who thought that was balance in any way where enemies not only do more damage but guns your guns do very less to the point where you might as well suicide and make death more quick. I thought they should just make the enemies do more damage and that's it, making the guns you have still worth something in the last remaining levels.\n\n2. Crosshair. I can barely see it at all, to where I start wondering if your even aiming or not. When the night vision is on I might as well just shoot with a blind fold on cause I can't see sh/t.\n\n3. Night vision. I think the next time night vision comes by, it should never be this bright green to the point where my eyes was going to sue my brain of making them look at bright lights that hurt. Please make sure you don't ever do what this game dose with it's night vision where is hurts when you need it to see in the bloody dark.\n\n( Now for the good parts of this game )\n\nOkay when I bought this I didn't want to play freeman cause everyone know about him already. I wanted to play someone in Half Life that is not freeman and that's what I got. \n\nFirst if you've played Half Life already then there's no point of explaining game play, so instead I like to tell how I felt in the game with shepherd the character you play as. Cause the same feeling in the first Half Life playing as freeman you will feel the same for what shepherd is feeling and thinking, that makes Half life so very good in story telling of the character you play as. You don't even need to hear them talk to know how they feel and that is just so good on allowing you to know the character with no words. Anyways here is how I felt playing as shepherd and what he was thinking in my view.\n\n(Shepherd) Our mission was very vague of what we were here for. It seem like any other mission at first. My squad won't shut up about what they were hoping this mission was. Idiots and that's why I like them. They were idiots but they were ready to take on anything. But not this.

First of all, I had this mouse problem, but it was no big deal, five minutes later it is solved. I had no more real game-breaking issues and was happy at the variety of aliens, enemies, and I even managed to beat the final boss! But something that lets the game down is the lack of people in multiplayer servers. The servers do not even add bots, which is upsetting, so you really are forced to A. get the bots, B. play on your own until a server does eventually get popular, or C. which is messing about in offline. Just remember that I don't have the bots and it is even worse for me. However the game has a good variety of problems and puzzles which makes it more rewarding to keep your team in one piece. I always do have do say like I did during my play through the first time round, where is a medic when you need them? Luckily the Scientists can heal Adrian as well. Also there are Easter eggs, and I know quite a few myself, but I recommend doing this \"egg hunt\" when you finish the game. Also there is a really unexpected map in this expansion and so old friends of Gordon are met, and no, the grunts aren't friendly, only OPFOR grunts are friendly, the HL1 grunts are not as nice ,and if not fighting anyone else before you, would shoot you on sight.

And the X-Race who are the toughest enemies who you will fight, and a new Headcrab Zombie known as the Gonomes who are tougher than regular zombies who can throw their guts at you as their ranged attack.\n\nAlong with new Allies such as some HECU Buddies such as the Engineer who can open welded doors and the Combat Medic who is a Portable Healing Station along with some HECU Grunts wielding an M249 SAW ( One of the new weapons that you can use. ) and a new Black Mesa Fat Security guard known as Otis who uses an Desert Eagle instead of an 9mm Pistol.\n\nLong Story short, you're playing as an HECU Grunt to clean up the Black Mesa incident, and things don't go to well and you're forced to fight the Black Ops and you have encountered a new Alien Race known as Race-X but you encounter your HECU Buddies and knowing that they are left behind and forced to fight the Black Ops and the Xen Aliens along with the after mentioned Race-X, you will find a lot of action in this Expansion Pack with some intense action in some chapters. But i'm leaving the important bits out of here.\n\nI have one complain though. Compared to the CD Retail version, the Menu Screen is less cooler compared to the Animated Title with Soldiers marching in the Opposing Force Title with Helicopters flying and Tanks moving to the Right.\nWhat we got is Adrian Shepard and Gordon Freeman holding Flags for the CTF Mode which i don't play ( Since play Half-Life mostly for it's Single Player Campaigns. )\n\nHowever that doesn't hurt what this Expansion Pack brings into Half-Life 1 for it's content. You got New Weapons to play with, New Enemies and Aliens to fight along with new Allies that will help you and a enjoyable single-player Campaign...\n\nAlso this Expansion pack introduces Rope Climbing which wasn't used in future Half-Life games or any other games made by Valve or Gearbox software... And also a Barnacle that you can use as an Weapon which is Opposing force's grappling hook.", "timestamp_created": 1550224433, "timestamp_updated": 1550224433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.53608250617980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48975259": {"recommendationid": "48975259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004035168", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 41430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11910, "last_played": 1554659494}, "language": "english", "review": "Opposing force is A very fun game that adds on to the already amazing classic, half-life. rather than try and make it out of the black mesa facility as Gordon Freeman, you're being sent in as an H.E.C.U, Corporal Adrian Sheperard.

As I have pointed out in my previous reviews for HL & HL Blue Shift the graphics may not be up to today\u2019s standards, the game play and AI are not overly sophisticated, but this is a trip down memory lane with one of the most important vintage FPS game changers.\n\nYou are either a HL fan or not, but there is no disputing the fact that there is still a huge HL community, creating some incredible mods, maps and keeping this game alive.\n \nAnyway, back to the review. Having played as Gordon & Barney - Half-Life: Opposing Force lets you see Half-life\u00b4s story through the eyes of Marine Corporal Adrian Shephard. Who, after surviving a helicopter crash, has to make his way through Black Mesa and survive (similar theme here). However, what I did like were some subtle changes in the game play and weapons.\n\n[*] The crowbar has been replaced with a wrench, which actually appeared to handle heavier with I felt added some realistic physics to the weapon.\n[*] The desert Eagle has a laser target; to be honest I do prefer to play with pistols rather than high powered weapons all the time. Having said that, the M249 SAW is just a weapon of mass carnage and is brutally fun.\n[*] There are a couple of new Alien Tech weapons such as the awesome Shock Roach, Spore Gun. One fun addition is the ability to collect Snarks (little deadly hyperactive bugs which you can throw and they run around attacking anything they can find, including you at times).\n\n[/list]Some other nice touches are the way you can get some actual help form the AI characters, as with HL and Blue Shift there is some interaction with Scientists who usually open doors or heal you and Security guards who help with shooting the aliens, HL OP takes AI co op a little further where you can join up with other Marines and actually do some real damage. In addition, finding a medic to help heal the engineer to flame cut a sealed door was definitely a nice addition for some limited squad based gameplay.\n\nOverall, Opposing Forces was a great way to end the debut of Half Life and each expansion pack added its own take on the Black Mesa Facility storyline. Opposing forces for me, and remember this is only my opinion, is a far better gameplay experience than the base HL release, however that is definitely down to the popularity of HL and the development of the game 2 years down the line.\n\nA definite must own for true FPS gamers.\n\nAlso worth checking out the walkthrough\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=163587409", "timestamp_created": 1549119397, "timestamp_updated": 1549119542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48707613": {"recommendationid": "48707613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119513145", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 2005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1376, "last_played": 1594975652}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life: Opposing Force is an expansion pack for Half-Life that lets you see Half-life\u00b4s story thru eyes of a H.E.C.U. marine Corporal Adrian Shephard.

The puzzles are kind of weak and i would say that the game is more combat based youll have to decide if that is a good thing i personally thought that the shooting in half-life games was pretty simple but here with such a large weapon variety i dont really mind it. Also there are a lot of new enemies like the shock troopers or Voltigores which both fall under a completely new alien race originally titled Race X.

It sure sounds like a good idea, but this game definitely isn't it.\n\nIt's a pathetic cop out. Your character (which of course speaks and you can't hear it, screw the very things that make Half-Life good) ends up surviving a helicopter crash (I sure have never heard of that before) and ends up running through plenty of poorly designed maps (of much lower quality than original Half-Life) with a ridiculous amount of invisible walls. By the time you get a gun in your hand, HECU is already retreating, and the entire plot is just artificially extended by G-Man closing your door right in front of you. His character doesn't even fit with how he normally acts, he participates in action too much.\n\nPerformance is atrocious at times, thanks to the abuse of dynamic lights. Enabling the night vision goggles causes the framerate to drop into star fox levels, much worse than original Half-Life (Valve is to blame here with their broken port of the goldsrc engine and patches removing functionality, but this game is so bad that it crashed on me, something no other goldsrc game ever did). Pretty much every elevator with mesh floor is broken, at times so bad that I can even get stuck using it normally. The entry vent to pit worm's nest has a known bug where it randomly causes you to get stuck on your way in, and nobody bothered to fix that, the only advice you can find is to load an earlier save and try again. The final boss fight has a game-breaking bug as well. In many cases, after defeating it nothing happens (in my case, nothing happened in all 3 times I've defeated it). That bug has been known for years, hasn't been fixed, and the ad-hoc solution is to manually load the final map from the console.\n\nGearbox HAD to shove their deviantArt-tier alien Race X (which Freeman and Calhoun haven't seen) into the game. They look like an attempt to model 3-year-old child's drawings and are probably as original as ones such a child would come up with. Ammo sponges is the best way I can describe them. There are WAY too many fights where you just get thrown against a way too large group of enemies, and it gets repetitive really quick. Do you hate black ops from Half-Life? Enjoy countless fights with them, ones where you end up with more enemies spawning should you decide to pick up some ammo or a medkit from an earlier area. The only enjoyable thing is the wrench, which while slow (not a problem since there are more melee weapons in this game, plenty of weapons feel like duplicates of each other) can gib characters instantly from their full health. The sad part is that you don't fight against Black Mesa personel, something I hoped for in this game. I expected to have moments where I have to fight against guards and slay scientists, all of them end up being friendly to you for no good reason. AI of soldiers you encounter is somehow worse than original Half-Life, at least they seem to be able to take more damage and have better weapons, so using them to conserve ammo works better (and there's way too little of it in the game, expect to run around enemies to have something for cases where you actually need to fight).\n\nThe idea with a detached barnacle used as a weapon is good, but of course it had to get executed poorly.\n\nIf you happen to own this game, don't even bother downloading it as it is a waste of time.\n\nTL;DR: the plot is a cop out, fights are repetitive and annoying, Gearbox took the source material too loosely and lost the grasp on what made Half-Life good, and replaced it with bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1547838814, "timestamp_updated": 1548007728, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.255774319171905518", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48387969": {"recommendationid": "48387969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137609930", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 850, "last_played": 1549484869}, "language": "english", "review": "\u201cThis place makes boot camp look like Disneyland\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1547750557, "timestamp_updated": 1547750557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48378175": {"recommendationid": "48378175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306677244", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 329, "last_played": 1558419423}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Get it now.", "timestamp_created": 1547707290, "timestamp_updated": 1547707290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48353778": {"recommendationid": "48353778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157624604", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1572741401}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the best game expansions of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1547587878, "timestamp_updated": 1547587878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48349200": {"recommendationid": "48349200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198450565659", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 545, "last_played": 1544551258}, "language": "english", "review": "a good expasion pack for the original hl", "timestamp_created": 1547570171, "timestamp_updated": 1547926802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48341368": {"recommendationid": "48341368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100477296", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 306, "last_played": 1547652822}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome if you have played the normal half life first.", "timestamp_created": 1547533917, "timestamp_updated": 1547533917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48321988": {"recommendationid": "48321988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090046087", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 215, "last_played": 1559360195}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like Half-Life, but it is very interesting to see the disaster at Black Mesa through the new perspective of Adrian Shepheard!

In this game, our arsenal is much more bigger with new weapons. Also we see new enemies and new kinds of places. These all new things are good additions to the original. However some of my problems are about that new features. First of all we go different places which we never been so new enemies could be endemic to these areas but after a while new beam shooting stronkk guys takes place of our asszapping teleporting boys and that doesnt really feel rigth even if it is caused by the portal Gordon jumped in which also let that flying psychic pearheads come to world. Other than that black latex wearing folks unoriginally take place of HECU because yeah, we are the HECU: badass villains of the first game that fight with every single living being until death or retreat command arrives. But for some reason we seem to be the good guys in this game. I am really disappointed by that fact as i expected to terrorize scientist and torture security guards until they tell the way out in this game but instead it mimicks the original game and makes us a protagonist instead of an antagonist.

The HECU side of the Black Mesa incident isn't too touched upon and thus it's really interesting to see what they went through and the little things happening behind the scenes. Opposing Force adds new weapons and enemy types. The weapons are quite fun and very satisfying to use and I like how the style is different from the original Half Life. The new enemies are more difficult than the original Half Life, they can soak up more damage and inflict more damage and get really annoying though their designs are quite cool. You also get new allies, HECU Marines, Engineers, and Medics can help you fight off enemies and it's kinda fun fighting like a squad with them. There are also climbing ropes that weren't seen in the original Half Life that you can swing from which are unique. This game is short though and you'll get about 2-4 hours of gameplay give or take (This is expected from an expansion though).\n\nAs I said before the new enemies in the game are quite annoying and challenging to face (at least for me). Especially the shock troopers which will pretty much constantly take down your health and can take alot of hits back if they aren't dealt with quickly.\n\nThis game is a nice sidestory and another perspective to the Black Mesa incident.

Along the way we fight assorted enemies including the aliens from the base game, a couple of aliens not from the base game, and the black ops unit from the first game. We\u2019re given an assortment of different weapons including a sniper rifle, machine gun, and a handheld version of the barnacle enemy complete with gross, long tongue!\n\nYou may even use some of these new weapons, but the easiest way to win is to stick with the basic pistol, which features a laser sight and is so absurdly powerful that there\u2019s really no reason to use any of the cool alien guns you\u2019re stocked up with over the game\u2019s runtime. The most fun I had with [i]Opposing Force[/i] was swinging on the janky barnacle tongue, which was great when it didn\u2019t bug out and kill me. The game has some very large areas compared to the base game, but unless you\u2019re playing this in 1999 there\u2019s nothing especially impressive going on here. [i]Opposing Force[/i]\u2019s real issue is that it has new weapons and levels, but no new ideas. Nothing as original or exciting as what was on display in the original [i]Half-Life[/i] is present here, and taking place concurrently with the base game just means it\u2019s treading water narratively as well as mechanically. The point is I went in with tempered expectations (I knew that this came out almost 20 years ago and that Gearbox made it), but was still disappointed. The temptation to play this expansions out of love for [i]Half-Life[/i] is a common one, and I cannot recommend strongly enough that you disregard it and just go outside instead.", "timestamp_created": 1544154996, "timestamp_updated": 1544154996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.380332589149475098", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47321499": {"recommendationid": "47321499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076673528", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 304, "last_played": 1544412900}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.

This game is so neck and neck for me between HL1 and this game. Half-life 1 wins though, but barely. This game is fu cking astounding, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the developers were on drugs when making this game. \n\nPROS: \n- I love the weapons in this game so much; my favorite being the Spore Launcher and it's my favorite HL weapon in general. There are so many fu cking weapons in this game, like what the fu ck why? BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! GAVE ME YOUR FU CKING WEAPONS!!! AARRRRRROOOOOOOOOO!!!! Ummmm?? Sorry about that, I don\u2019t know what that was.\n- The story is really good, you play as Adrian Shephard, a marine sent in to clean up the Black Mesa incident. It\u2019s really good man trust me.\n- YOU DON\u2019T PLAY THROUGH MUCH OF XEN!! FU CK YEAH!!!\n- I love the new enemies too, really good\n- For some reason, this game is really fu cking HARD!!!!! And I like that.\n\nOkay so everything else is pretty much in my HL1 review for pros because it\u2019s an expansion pack, so it\u2019s basically the same game. Now for the cons\u2026\u2026.\n\nCONS:\n- This game is too short, I want to play more god damn it!!\n- Honestly, I don\u2019t care much for the soundtrack. A lot of the tracks feel like they have the same beat. WTF!!???\n- I hate the ending because Shephard never comes back in the future games. I\u2019ve always wanted a conclusion to his story, but it never happened. There are some mods out there that do try, like HL2 awakening\u2026\u2026\u2026.. does anyone remember that mod? No? Same here. Well, there\u2019s Prospekt on stream: sorry Rich but your game sucks asss and I didn\u2019t enjoy it. But it\u2019s not on my worst mods list of all time like Wilson Chronicles and HTDF, so there\u2019s that. Anyways Rich, please put your money to good use, I\u2019m counting on you. *KISS ON THE FOREHEAD* Hopfully you're doing something with that money, right???? Since I mentioned Wilson Chronicles and HDTF, I might as well say how HDTF is worse than when England touched the fu cking White House back in 1814, and Wilson Chronicles makes me want to have a fu cking lobotomy. There\u2019s Opposing Force 2, looks awesome and fun. TO BAD IT\u2019S FU CKING DEAD AND LOST FOREVER!!!  You know, I don't even care if he comes back in HL3 and all he does is just takes a sh it and then dies right after. I just what to know what the happened to him.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s about it for me, I love this game from my heart to my di ck. But don\u2019t play this game first if you've never played Half-life before, play Half-life 1 first then play this game.

The game goes on forever, it just keeps going, on and on and on and on, it picks up some time late in Half-Life. There's actually, shockingly no clear plot or anything, since maybe a chapter or two in you get to the point where you're going to leave Black Mesa with the rest of the soldiers, and G-Man steps in to stop you... for some reason, and then the rest of the game is just nonsense. You just... go through Black Mesa, fightin' and killin' everything in your way.\n\nThe only things not hostile to you this time are Black Mesa personnel and fellow soldiers, but there's a new faction of 'black ops' troops who are out to get you... for some reason, so you have to fight those guys. For the most part, your enemies are pretty much just vortigaunts, houndeyes and headcrabs for the first half of the game, then after about that point you're just fighting these weird lookin things which run up and claw you, and then for the last third or so it's almost exclusively these giant things that spit purple lightning balls at you, and these ground troops which shoot blue laser balls.\n\nIt's actually horrible, everything does huge amounts of damage to you and there's not much you can do to stop it. I never felt so consistently outgunned in any of the other games, and it might have something to do with the fact that after about the halfway mark, I think Gearbox just completely forgot about giving you anything to do with HP or armor. You're supposed to be able to charge up your combat armor with these military grade chargers as well as the HEV suit chargers, and during training you even see a third party one, but honestly I think I only saw one or maybe two military chargers during the whole game.\n\nAdditionally, health is a huge problem. After that halfway mark or so, they just stop placing the medkits on walls, so you only have rarely, a big bunch of crates in a room that have maybe 3-4 health kits as items which restore about 15 hp each, so gaining 45 to 60 health at once. This is nice, but I really felt up against it for that entire third or half of the game, if you ever make a mistake and drop to like 10 or 20 hp, that's it, that's pretty much all you get for what feels like another chapter or so.\n\nThere's this one really annoying bit where there's this tunnel system with a whole ton of these spider lookin things that shoot purple lightning, and they take a LOT of hits to kill, and I mean a LOT, like multiple shots with a rocket launcher. I found that the BFG or whatever it is does about 1-shot them as long as you hit them with it, but you only get five shots anyway.\n\nI think it says a lot that I played this game for not even 5 hours, and it felt like 10.\n\nThe first third of the game or so feels pretty good, it's fun enough, and playing as Shepard is novel enough to keep you interested, but from then on, perhaps after G-Man stops you boarding the helicopter out, that's when the game just sort of takes a dive. I don't know why, it just stops being fun. Maybe it's because they never really give you anything else to do, and the game culminates in an absolutely pathetic excuse for a boss fight. It doesn't even work properly on Linux, what I found is that once you kill the boss, its model sort of bugs out and it instantly disappears, and it doesn't let you finish the game unless you manually change level to it via the console.\n\nThere's some other issues too, like the game not giving you weapons early enough. For example, the Barnacle. You get an actual Barnacle as a 'gun' in this game. You just kind of use it to grapple enemies, you can grab headcrabs and they are tugged right into the maw of the Barnacle, chomp, it's crunched into a giblets. But, anything larger than that, and you get pulled towards it like a grappling hook. Now, everyone knows grappling hooks are super awesome, why didn't they give it to us earlier? You get it only a couple chapters before the end of the game!\n\nLike Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, there's a bunch of stuff in the tutorial which doesn't really feel like it's made enough of a big deal of in the game itself. An example is the ropes, in Opposing Force you can climb ropes which act kind of like actual physics objects, it's very impressive, the only issue is the game doesn't really do much with them. I'm not sure if it was a technical limitation or not, but either way, they're very few and far between and the only few times you get to use them are usually just... climbing up a small distance you could have just had a ladder for.\n\nA better use could have been something like... having you use an elevator, it stops, so you need to grab onto the electrical cable and climb down instead while it plummets down below and explodes. That'd be cool! People like seeing stuff blow up. Instead, they're almost all 'just kind of there'.\n\nI should talk a little more about the final boss. It's just a big squid, it can't move, and to kill it you just shoot it in each eye with a pair of laser guns you have to press E to use, and then you shoot it in it's... portal mouth thing until it dies. It's boring, not challenging, and while the Nihilanth in Half-Life is constantly speaking to you, whispering stuff in your ear like as soon as you get to Xen, this thing just kind of shows up! A guard says \"hey there's a bad thing coming through a portal and you gotta kill it\" and you do that and that's the end of the game. It just ends, G-Man shows up to tell you you're going to be put away now and then it ends. It's very disappointingy.\n\nIt's a shame that we never really got a sequel or anything, I'd actually love to see that today, with a stronger emphasis on the differences between the scientist, Dr. Freeman and the veteran soldier, Corporal Adrian Shepard, but... Gearbox is a huge company now, and they probably wouldn't even care about doing it. Valve don't really make games anymore, and everyone's kind of forgotten about Half-Life.\n\nI can't say I disliked Opposing Force, some parts of it are really great. The soldiers are ALL just hamming it up, it's great, you get an intro that's reminiscent of Predator, there's one part with a trash compactor which is like 1:1 with the scene from Star Wars, and the few occasions you get to lead around some of your fellow soldiers, it's fun, it's good, it's just a shame it can't remain like that throughout the whole thing.

It has similar problems to Blue Shift and the base game on GldSrc, but that's mostly due to the engine itself rather than the game's fault. I still did had to cheat in some places because I didn't feel like dying and reloading a save file a million times or they seemed to have ledges imposible to reach. Besides those few flaws, Opposing Force is an excellent add-on focusing less on confusing puzzles and frustrating navigation and moreso on the combat and sometimes controlling your...questionable squad.\n\nYeah the friendly AI in Opposing Force is shit for a 90s game and even so compared to Half Life and Blue Shift. A few times you have to protect friendly AI which enemies can easily kill so watch out! This takes 5-6 hours to beat, almost as long as the base game, the action and immersion was pretty good with slightly better plot and progression. Enemies aren't overpowered anymore and you have new weapons that make the fighting less annoying than the base game...except for those damn Black Ops which are even more buffed in Opposing Force with 2 types. G-Man seems to help you a soldier named Corporal Shepard at times yet will hinder your progress to extend the plot I guess.\n\nI'm not sure if Opposing Force or Blue Shift was included free for Half Life 1 owners, but even if it's now now that is a plus and is very cheap especially on sale so definitley buy this. Unlike Blue Shift and Source, there's also multiplayer albeit with empty and dead servers and playing from a different perspective lets you explore totally new areas that aren't super dark and generic like Blue Shift and spices things up as a soldier. The training tutorial isn't a complete knock-off like Blue Shift's and it's very funny and innovative. I think since the enemies aren't as ridiculous as the other two titles I could probably enjoy this add-on even on normal difficulty; I've beaten this twice and hope to beat it again soon.",

This game, while being about half as long from start to end, is just as good as the HL 1. Maybe even better in some circumstances. It offers several new weapons not found in Half Life, at the expense of a few from HL1 not appearing at all. In addition, not only does Opposing Force have new weapons and level design, it has has entirly new enemy types, mostly for the aliens which you spend most of the game fighting, unlike HL1 where you alternated between military and aliens for most of the game. One of the other benefits is that it doesn't have any real BAD levels. While HL1 had excellent level design, with good mix of shooting,  platforming, and puzzle solving, it also had several moments or levels that fustrated me greatly. From my playthrough of this, I can only really recall a couple of moments that bothered me personally (like the area where if you hit certain explosives you instantly die, just like in HL1 or the final area with the high and strong enemy count). Though it was less the levels themselves and more the enemies you fight. Compared to HL1, Opposing Force throws you against stronger enemies a lot more often, and while it's not terrible, I found it easier to ignore some battles rather than fight my way through. Especially in the final area where they have several rooms that just throw enemies at you with reckless abandon. This does work well for people who wanted a tougher game, but I feel like Half-Life 1 was at a good level of challenge, minus some cheap bullshit it pulled. So I'm not sure if I like the higher base difficulty overall. Another issue is that like Blue Shift, the story is pretty much throwaway. Though, I do appreciate that we see a different view of the situation, even if I think they could have done more with it. (These guys are supposed to go after Freeman, making them like the bad guys killing everything. But then they just turn out to be victims too, which I feel was kind of a cop out) Overall, while there are a few nags I have with the game, it's far outwieghed by the positives of being more Half-Life 1, and the new things it brought to the table. That doesn't even include multiplayer. Yeah, this game had multiplayer. Really odd, but still a nice addition regardless. If you have a spare $5 (or less if you wait for the Valve bundle pack sale) and want more Half-Life, this is an easy yes. You owe it to yourself to play it if you like Half-Life, but haven't touched this game at all.", "timestamp_created": 1533528877, "timestamp_updated": 1533528877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583136200904846191", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43862141": {"recommendationid": "43862141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276744159", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 40, "last_played": 1590164170}, "language": "english", "review": "The real Hunt Down the Freeman.", "timestamp_created": 1533074978, "timestamp_updated": 1533074978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43843528": {"recommendationid": "43843528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040867274", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 33, "last_played": 1499287298}, "language": "english", "review": "i got gud 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1532990313, "timestamp_updated": 1532990313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43839436": {"recommendationid": "43839436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113448012", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 696, "last_played": 1533121764}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so good , i can't express my love about it.

Much like the original HL, Blue Shift and this, I simply never got around to it.  I guess I was too busy playing all the great mods that came out because of HL.  Regardless this is a pretty good game.  A dated game mind you, but still pretty good.  If you enjoyed the original game you should enjoy this as well.  Decent length for an add on, which was about twice as long as Blue Shift, but that still pales in comparison to the original game.  Those not wanting to have to sit through all of HL again, may enjoy a quicker romp through Black Mesa and on the way see side stories that add to the HL universe.\n\nThis time around, instead of being Dr. Freeman or the security guard Barney (Original or Blue Shift), you are US Marine Cpl. Shephard in route to Black Mesa.  Your transport is shot down before the standing orders are given to everyone however...  So you are basically left to your own devices in trying to escape the facility.  You meet up with fellow squad mates from time to time, which you can use to advance, security guards and even jittery scientists.  You also have new weapons at your disposal and a slew of new enemies to compliment the old ones, some brain teasers that will have you scratching your head for a solution and you will of course see new areas of Black Mesa.\n\nHowever the game is not without it's flaws.  Again by now the graphics are outdated.  There is just no way around it.  If you are spoiled on the latest or even decade old graphics, this may not be your bag.  Also they claim you can control your team and give orders.  Sadly this was no different than when you could control the scientists from the original game.  You just use the USE key, they follow and use a blow torch to cut through a door.  That is it.  Maybe you can ask a medic to heal you, but there are so many health packs laying around you really didn't need him.  I was expecting strategy and team work with my fellow soldiers, but there was none of that.  And they die too quickly in a fire fight anyway, even with a medic present.  In fact I am not even sure the medic can heal himself or others if not scripted in the story.  If they could of done better with that expect, I would of praised it much higher.\n\nAlso coming from a military background I was a little annoyed at certain weapons having characteristics that they should not have, as well as the night vision goggles that was designed to act as the flashlight in the other games, but it is a game so what ever.  ^_^  Due to the nature of the game being an add on and so dated, I would get it on sale for a dollar.  Nothing to complain about at that price.  And it is that price now as of this writing.

This one just feels lazy, the obvious solution sometimes isn't even the solution at all. I had a situation where I met a dead end with a vent I couldn't reach and a window leading to a fall that would easily kill me, there wasn't anything I could move or climb to get to the vent so after a few minutes I smashed the window out of frustration and jumped out to- what I thought would be my death only to find a small ledge beneath me that was impossible to see before. A few rooms down I come across a similar problem and bam. Indestructible window. What you're supposed to do is shove your hand up a barnacle's arse and swing across a chasm spiderman style. That is not a joke.\n\nHealth/ammo supplies are so low I thought the game was kidding. The new enemies are crack shots and don't feel like the running breathing shooting living AI that you'd find in Half-Life. And they are practically stuffed into levels at an absurd amount to the point that progressing is a brutal slog rife with save-scumming, a constant war of attrition where every hit you take feels like an instant failure, not even in an intense way. Just frustrating.\n\nStory starts off ok, seeing the story from the perspective of the HECU was a logical next step for HL. The first few minutes capture the chaos of the original game pretty well, the Black Mesa scientists attempting to save the protagonist and his team not even knowing they were sent there to kill just about everything in Black Mesa was pretty cool. The story stops there though, you spend the rest of the game just running along until the G-man lets you know when you won it.\n\nIt feels weird to say there were too many weapons in a thing, but there are. 16 weapons. In the last leg of the game you must get a good three of them and not a whole lot of time to figure out what they do. By the end of it I spent more time fighting the weapon select than I did any actual aliens, and who needs two melee weapons?\n\nFriendly AI is just as bad as it's always been, don't really want to follow you very much, get stuck a lot and killed more.

Since I already elaborated on these points in my review of Half-Life, however, I don't want to repeat myself, so I'll like to elaborate on a couple other things I liked about this game. When I fought against the marines in the original game, it seemed like they were the villains, but the elaboration of the Black Ops in this game (they were introduced in the main game, but we didn't know much of anything about who they were as we didn't have access to the Marines' equipment) made it seem like they were the true villains. It was an interesting shift which made me question my reaction to the main game. I also liked the extra insight on the G-Man. While most of the details on his character are ambiguous (as they were in the main game), we learn a couple other details about his character (more specifically, actions he takes at the end of the game) which further hint at the bigger picture suggested in the first game. I did notice a couple bugs in this game though. For instance, it was sometimes difficult to get the Marines to follow you as they'd often get stuck. Also, my mouse occasionally flashed on the right hand side of the screen. Other than these minor bugs, however, I'd say this game is worth buying.", "timestamp_created": 1528851409, "timestamp_updated": 1532026709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42687899": {"recommendationid": "42687899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114563111", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 501, "last_played": 1586998235}, "language": "english", "review": "An expansion to the awesomely awesome game that is Half Life. \n\nThis time the story of Half Life is told from the perspective of a HECU marine. \n\nIf you enjoyed Half Life, you'll enjoy this.

It follows the misadventures of Adrian Shephard, a military goon turned Gordon Freeman-esque action hero after getting sent in to neutralize the events of the original Half-Life.\n\nA solid campaign and thrilling techno score will probably be the most engaging parts of this product, although the original game still had both. The new editions to the mix aren't considerably interesting, and a few of the added monsters are more frustrating than enjoyable. I thought the final boss was pretty interesting looking but critically easy to fight and not particularly interesting gameplay-wise. The new perspective, that is, a soldier, doesn't really contribute much with anything. I was hoping to see some ally soldiers who would fight alongside me, and although I did find a few, they were largely pointless, dying as easily as the security guards from Half-Life 1. Ultimately, this product just feels pointless, even if it does provide more of the quintessential Half-Life experience.\n\nPlot-wise, this game is fairly barren as well. If you can't get enough of the G-Man, perhaps just look up his final speech on youtube, because although it is a creepy and enjoyable speech, it isn't enough. The only context in which I'd recommend this game is if you can't get enough of the original Half-Life flavor in your noggin. Fortunately for Gearbox, a lot of people can't, and neither could I.\n\nAs it is, it's a tough-as-nails corridor shooter with aggressive ai and a pretty well utilized score. More than enough to recommend it, but not exactly with flying colors.

It's an overpraised, watered down, boring, frustrating downgrade of Half Life, a game which is already a mixed bag.\n\nStory:\n\nhalf life but u r solder. That's it. It might as well be a level pack for Half Life. \n\nAI:\n\nAnnoying. It's good, but annoying. Nothing much to say there.\n\nWeapons:\n\nThe old weapons are not worth mentioning, so I won't, but I will talk about the new ones. The melee weapons are just the crowbar, but fast or slow. The Barnacle is cool, but underused. The Desert Eagle is basically the Magnum but better. The SAW Machine Gun is basically the Machine Gun but better. The Sniper Rifle is cool, but underused. The Spore Launcher is cool, but underused. The Shock Roach is really cool. So is the Displacer Cannon. Overall, they're almost all similar to other weapons or underused. Again, might as well just be a level pack for Half Life.\n\nEnemies: \n\nAgain, the old ones aren't worth mentioning, so I'll only talk about the new ones. They can all die in a fucking hole. The Pit Drones are bullet sponges. They're just there to get rid of ammo. The Shock Troopers are also there to get rid of ammo, but also there to get rid of health. Vortigores are also there to get rid of ammo and health, but are 10 times more annoying. The boss enemies are basically just the tentacles monsters from Blast Pit. It seems like everything in this game that's \"new\" is just copies of older things.\n\nLevel Design:\n\nRemember those puzzles that were impossible without a guide? Remember those \"Where the fuck do I go?\" moments? Imagine a game where those happened every time you killed a group of enemies. That game you just imagined is basically Half Life: Opposing Force.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThat's everything new.

It is, however in the end you just basically fight for your life against alliens and black-ops, but the atmosphere of catching Freeeman is still there, which is great. Gameplay is good (I thought the campaign was longer, but I have finished it under 6 hours), we have a bunch of new weapons with pretty neat functions (that desert eagle with laser sights is my favourite and machine gun with its kickback is crazy), alien weapons are good too, level architecture is really nice and we have a few new enemies and bosses. Lot of new atractive enviroments - biodomes, testing areas, biolabs, exteriors in desert and even the training mission was fun. Ropes adds a new feature to the gameplay, however they are not used really extensively (and the last one was buggy as hell, I was always  magically stucked on the wall for some unknown reason).

Half-Life: Opposing Force is an amazing game that deserves a try or a replay if you owned it back when it came out, it will go down as one the of the best \"Half Life\" games ever made and still represents the classic FPS genre that we all used to love, and for $4.99 its a F****** Steal. 90%", "timestamp_created": 1522203807, "timestamp_updated": 1522204030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41075960": {"recommendationid": "41075960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988903500", "num_games_owned": 1759, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1244, "last_played": 1512431223}, "language": "english", "review": "Opposing Force is a great example why I will always prefer the expansion pack method of adding content to a game over DLC or micro transactions. This game is arguably even better than the original Half-Life in a lot of aspects and in any discussion about Half-Life you will have people who will list this as their all time favorite Half-Life game. It's for a good reason obviously considering how much the game expands upon the formula and mechanics of the first Half-Life. \n\nThe game introduces a ton of new content in all aspects. You have a new alien faction known as \"race-x\" that ramps up the difficulty and challenge in the game a ton and in general this game is quite a bit harder than the original Half-Life so I recommend playing it AFTER you complete the original Half-Life, while the game starts out with just normal Xen enemies once the race-x dudes start showing up you are going to realize how dangerous things have gotten when your trapped in a sewer with the big race-x dudes who shoot giant fucking death balls at you that can kill instantly if you are in the direct way of the ball. The game also expands upon the \"black-ops\" by making them a separate faction from HECU and adding appropriate units to replace what would be marine enemies in the original Half-Life. There is also a great number of more companians available to the player including medic's which in addition to being capable of firing back at the enemy also can heal the player and other friendly units, you have engineers who can cut through doors with their blow torch, and of course just normal grunts who dont have any special ability's per say but usually come with a pretty good weapon like a shotgun or assault rifle. You also have a new security guard in addition to your normal Barney's who's called \"Otis\" and he is a pretty amusing and interesting character to have and, again, spices up the content by adding more variety. \n\nThe arsenal the player is capable of carrying has been drastically expanded upon including two different melee weapons in place of half-life 1's single melee weapon and multiple alien and experimental weapons. A big stand out to me was the teleporter gun which can one hit \"kill\" an enemy by essentially teleporting him to a random location presumably somewhere in Xen, but the secondary fire will teleport you yourself to a random location in Xen that can only be accessed in that way and often contains many resources and a teleport on the other side which will get you back into black mesa at a fixed position that is usually later in the level, which is interesting because it essentially allows you to skip whole parts of levels as long as you have the ammo to utilize the alt-fire. There is also a barnacle weapon which the player can use to grapple across gaps and walls at points as well as latch on to enemies and pull it into its maw which the barnacle will proceed to devour, really creative and diverse weapons loadout for sure. \n\nThe story adds a lot of interesting new lore to the Half-Life story besides just a new alien race by clarifying on the relationship between the soldiers and the black-ops and a pretty disturbing plot point of what happens to the marines who fail to evacuate or are left behind after the order to pull out comes out. It also expands on the character of the G-man giving new insight into his \"personality\" and actions as well as expanding on the ending to half-life by showing what happens to black mesa itself after everything is said and done. \n\nThe multiplayer has also been expanded upon with many maps and game-modes that the original Half-Life simply does not have. \n\nThe only bad part of playing this thing is after playing such an awesome game your going to be tempted to recall the current state of gearbox software and feel a bit of despair at the whole thing. Its like if somebody who you like and highly respected joined a skinhead gang, became a gay prostitute and contracted aids and than went around snorting cocaine and beating up homeless people and stray dogs and puppy's before shooting up an old folks home before blowing himself up and screaming \"hail Satan\" as his last words.

Gearbox obviously tried so hard to make the game not feel too familiar to the original that they would add the new stuff and replace some content with better versions. The Barnacle as a weapon is a very special surprise to me, we have teleporting guns, there are replacements such as the revolver being placed by the more-functional Desert Eagle, and we are fighting primarily against a race of aliens known as Race X, comprising species other than those in the original game, not to mention that the flashlight has been replaced by night vision.\n[b]+[/b] As a bonus for enthusiasts of multiplayer, functionality is expanded to not only include Deathmatch as in the original [i]Half-Life[/i] as well as additional levels, but Capture the Flag as well.\n[b]-[/b] Sadly, there are cases where there are under-demonstrations of the improvements such as the ropes as well as over-demonstration of certain improvements at a time that can render the game a bit repetitive, specifically late in it.

Before I'm fighting a few Shock Troopers, afterwards I'm running for my life in a tunnel full of raging Voltigores. The Portal Launcher is a great scientific weapon, and to me the most fascinating. Causing decent damage if aimed well, but unlike with the Gluon Gun and the Tau Cannon I found that it wasn't too handy combat wise, but came instead to more use in terms of support. Its alt fire teleports you to a part of the Xen world, each with either healing pools, supplies from fallen HEV scientists or both which I found to be incredible, as well as being teleported to a different environment each time. However, the alt fire requires 60 or more power. \n\nThere are 2 boss fights in this marvel of a game, both of which are great fun and not too frustrating. Also, I loved how the training room had a military boot camp setting, and I recommend you play the training room since it truly is spectacular and teaches you some of the new features such as rope swinging.

Taking place during the original Half-Life, you play as Corpral Adrian Shepard. You are sent to Black Mesa on an unknown mission. However, the mission isn't important anymore as you have to escape the facility after you crash right into an alien invasion.\n\nTo start off, the concept of focusing on the opposite side of the protagonist is very interesting, and I liked that. The gameplay itself is the same as the original, just shooting a lot of enemies, and solving puzzles. In this game you get a variety of new weapons (though some of them are pretty much the same, even if they are \"new\"). Weapons that stood out to me was the sniper-rifle, some weird alien fish that shoots acidic slimeballs (which your character pets for some reason), and you can even use the alien Barnicle to use as a grappling hook or use it to eat a target. \n\nThough these weapons can be seen as overpowered, one complaint I had with this game is the ridiciously more overpowered new enemies introduced into this game. You have a giant alien that shoots a powerful 1 hit ko attack, oh, and these things hang out in groups too, so good luck fighting them. I played this game on easy and it was still stupidly difficult for no reason at all.\n\nOverall, though I had some pretty tough rage-inducing moments, I still enjoyed the game a lot. From the new weapons, and the story, also some callbacks to the original game. These I think really do weigh down the major complaint I had with the game, the overpowered enemies. I would give HL:OF, a 6.5/10.

You'll get on an elevator, activate it, and the elevator simply won't move because your body has frozen in place and is stopping it from being able to, y'know, BE AN ELEVATOR.\nAnother is where you'll die randomly when activating certain machinery, such as the Star-Wars; A New Hope garbage compactor rip off, where upon activating it, if you try to move, you will just...Die. Out of the blue. \n\nThe lore as well, is an absolute insult to the Half-Life series. While Half-Life: Blueshift kept promise and stayed true to the series (But was disappointingly short), Opposing Force chooses to just throw in another batch of aliens into the mix. They are used as both the main 'Opposing force' to Opposing Force. The normal Xen aliens were practically thrown out the window, and are seldom used after the first few chapters (Minus headcrabs, Zombies and five Vortigaunts). \n\nYou'd believe that these new enemies would include the Black Mesa personnel that are terrified of being butchered by highly trained Marines who have difficulty spelling, right?\n\nNope.\n\nThe game has ALL of the facility staff that you meet as friendly as possible, all practically running around naked, and none of the scientists even bothering to wear a Hazardous Environment Suit (Which must have been very well available due to how many bodies of dead HEV Scientists you find within Xen) and attempting to fight you and your men. \n\nWhat could you possibly replace the HECU with as the main human enemy within this horrid game?\nBlack Ops.\nYou read that right.\nBlack ops.\n\nWhen originally, the Black Ops had only females whose relations with the HECU were unknown; Male Black Ops were added, practically being HECU that attack the HECU. Do they work as an Antagonist? Yes, they do, very well. However it simply doesn't make sense.\n\nThe HECU are advanced trained Marines that were sent into Black Mesa as a cleanup crew; The fact that they thought that  once a group as experienced as the HECU were unable to complete their job, that instead of just sending in another HECU Team to plant a nuke and extract, that they send in Black Ops to eliminate every NON-EXTRACTED HECU within Black Mesa, alongside all scientists, security officers and Aliens (Mind you, who ultimately fail at even successfully activating the bomb without the Gmans interference) is just retarded.\n\nAll in all;\nIt's a 'fun' action game with frustrating glitches and a horribly written story. Even the final boss fight is horrible.\nMy disappointment is immeasureable and my day is ruined.", "timestamp_created": 1514643209, "timestamp_updated": 1514643209, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488764375448226929", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38849492": {"recommendationid": "38849492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202822808", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 356, "last_played": 1514437957}, "language": "english", "review": "More of the halflife action you love but this time you get to play as Adrian Shepard, a soilder who is ordered to hunt down gordon freeman.

The single concept is already interesting on its own because we experience the great Black Mesa incident from who is supposed to be the enemy of Gordon Freeman. In addition to that the game has several new elements that make this expansion a fresh experience. Let's see what Opposing Force has to offer.\n\n\n[h1][i][PLOT][/i][/h1]\n\nThe protagonist, Adrian Shephard, is someone who was sent to fulfill a mission that any other soldier could have done. However, he ended up doing something much bigger, something that had an impact on the future of the whole world. I don't know if it would have been for better or worse but the sequel, Half-Life 2, would have been completely different if Shephard had failed. Personally I would have liked to know more about him in the sequels but unfortunately Valve never developed the character any further. And since it's very unlikely that Valve'll release a new Half-Life game in the future things will probably stay that way.\n\n\n[h1][i][GAMEPLAY][/i][/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is practically the same as the first Half-Life. The movement, the weapons, the enemies, everything is great, fluid and responsive. In addition to this there are new cool weapons, both of military and alien origin. New enemies, the Race X, which is are completely unrelated to the Xen creatures, and that add a new feeling and pacing to the game. Opposing Force is not a copy of the first game, it's an original adventure located at the same time as it is.\n\n\n[h1][i][VISUALS][/i][/h1]\n\nThe same as the first game, although with a slightly greater amount of details. The graphics for its time were pretty good. The FPS' were still developing aesthetically and Half-Life was a step forward without a doubt. It's obvious that by today's standards it isn't impressive. However, for me the visuals of this game are a classic, a stamp that was won over the years product of the nostalgia of players like me.\n\n\n[h1][i][MUSIC & SOUND][/i][/h1]\n\nIt's the same as the original game so it inherits all the good elements of it, although new material is needed. It seems to me they just reused SFX and music of the original game. It's good to hear the anazing music of the original game again, but I would also have liked to hear something new.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Half-Life: Opposing Force is an incredible expansion. It inherits all the good elements of the original game and expands upon it. I recommend you to play this if you loved the original game, like me!\n\nMy rating is:  [b]8.5 / Excellent.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1510980669, "timestamp_updated": 1514264603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36582108": {"recommendationid": "36582108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358963407", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1096, "last_played": 1576353065}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is crazy and awesome so cool good job gear box and thanks for publishing it valve", "timestamp_created": 1510957319, "timestamp_updated": 1511725568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36576063": {"recommendationid": "36576063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158868628", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1784, "last_played": 1579943841}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is what got me into half life and its as good as half life 1 both games are masterpieces", "timestamp_created": 1510938183, "timestamp_updated": 1579799704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36560225": {"recommendationid": "36560225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137236227", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 479, "last_played": 1566358900}, "language": "english", "review": "it's more halflife.\n\nsure.", "timestamp_created": 1510871900, "timestamp_updated": 1510871900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534050166606903076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36502659": {"recommendationid": "36502659", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995935948", "num_games_owned": 445, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 23770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8333, "last_played": 1577902495}, "language": "english", "review": "Great single player campaign and definitely the best expansion for HL 1 (sorry Blue Shift).

As expected, things go awry and you are alone facing the good-old aliens.\n\nThis is the best add on to Half-Life in my opinion. There are new weapons and not a single crowbar. You can also create a time paradox. Race X creatures are really good enemies and the gene worm is a lot more threatening than a gargantua and a PCV suit instead of an HEV suit or an armour vest. You get to interact with other soldiers and maybe even create a small group. I really have nothing negative to say about this, everything works well.

Great addition to the original story. You're fighting on the opposite side this time, with troops trying to catch freeman. Several radio discussions from the original HL are caught here too, you can figure out how some levels are happening in parallel with the plot from the base game.\n\nNew weapons are really cool.
