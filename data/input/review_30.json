These games may have helped to set them, but the double-edged sword is that they are the very basic forms of what is available to us now, therefore making them pretty much useless for anyone besides avid fans to come back and experience. Unlike single-player games of the same era, although games have evolved on that front as well, there are many factors that make those experiences unique and worth coping with outdated controls and graphics in order to witness a good or even great game in its original state. With a title such as \"Day of Defeat\", your only option is to play solely multiplayer, and you have to rely on other people being active on servers you want to play on, otherwise there really is no experience left for the player to take advantage of. Since time only moves forward, eventually this game will lose all value solely based on the fact it will lose its entire base, and in turn, be mostly forgotten. This is expected of a multiplayer experience, but this game has failed to make an impact in the same way many other multiplayer games have, and those games usually have a single-player experience that tags along to give a timelessness to the game, unlike \"Days of Defeat\".\n\nA main problem with this game I don't see with something such as \"Team Fortress Classic\" is that I struggle to see the value of playing this game even at the time it was released. There are things about it I do appreciate and enjoy, such as the premise, style, and design, but ultimately the bad and frustrating issues outweigh the good by a baffling margin. A huge problem is the player base itself, those who have either mastered the game or figured the best way to oust fair players are the only ones really playing this game nowadays, not new players that dilute the waters to create a more balanced experience for all who wish to give this game a shot. The shooting is rather basic as well, this was released before mainstream implementation of aiming down sights, and since there are many players camouflaged and well versed in the game's strengths and weaknesses, it makes it that much harder to get into this game as a newer player. The maps here seem more simplistic and unpolished than in other games of the same time, making traversing them and attempting to best the enemy team a boring and difficult affair in the worst way possible. You'll be luckier than most if you are able to hone your skills and restrain from giving up on this relic of the past like many have before.\n\n\"Day of Defeat\" is one of those very forgettable games that no one really mentions when you talk about Valve and their more than impressive line-up of releases. At least with a fair amount of these sorts of titles, I can see the value that they held when they came out and that they aren't up to today's standards based solely on the fact that they set those standards decades ago, but \"Days of Defeat\" feels like an outlier that really was just an alternative to the truly excellent games the industry was releasing at the time, not a main attraction.\n\n[RATING: 4.6/10]", "timestamp_created": 1581981492, "timestamp_updated": 1599209772, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494501352310180664",

Its nothing like the tommy gun though it might be fully automatic like the tommy but the kick is different and the general feel of the gun is much different and it makes for a very fun experiance when playing.\n\nSOUND DESIGN:\nThis game has some amazing sound design not only for the weapons but also the world around you!\nfor starters after you play this game for a couple of hours and get to play as both sides you can start to hear the difference in american weaponry and german weaponry. You can be pushing forward to the enemy and then you hear gunshots not only can you hear where its coming from but it might sound a little like the american weapons that you might be using but theres a certian crack or deeper tone that you can hear and it can help you figure out if its enemy or a friend. Then you have the foot steps they are the same for both you and the enemy but the advatage would be your mini map, its your best friend in sneaky combat situations your friends have a circle with a pointer pointing to where there look at, and if you hear footsteps extremely near by and you look up at your mini map and you don't see any friendlies around then you better get ready to fight! Now for the ambience, it can be very imersive to be sitting inside of a building antisipating some one to enter and not only do you hear the combat nearby which sounds amazing but you will also hear distant combat in some of the maps and there is also artilary fire in a certain area which really adds to the atmosphere. I really love the sound design for this game!\n\nMAP DESIGN:\nI really love the maps for this game it is open to all of the classes that you are able to play it has sniper posts, spots for mgs then its got cover in the best areas and even cover that if it is taken advantage of correctly it can make that spot quite op both sides of the maps are always equally balanced the maps also have areas where you can place charges and blow out a wall or a door to allow for an advantage or it could be your downfall ,and it makes for some very fun and imersive maps.", "timestamp_created": 1576351987, "timestamp_updated": 1584591133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59781002": {"recommendationid": "59781002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198371790488", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 470, "last_played": 1594669199}, "language": "english", "review": "dank", "timestamp_created": 1576261054, "timestamp_updated": 1576261054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59736044": {"recommendationid": "59736044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333436853", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 906, "last_played": 1590346997}, "language": "english", "review": "awsome game", "timestamp_created": 1576190624, "timestamp_updated": 1576190624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "59598998": {"recommendationid": "59598998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104611758", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 965, "last_played": 1575969644}, "language": "english", "review": "Day of Defeat is one of the coolest Half-Life mods ever.

Or at least it seems that way, as I'm by no means an expert in WWII.\n\nWhile I haven't played much, I enjoyed the little I played; which was mostly in the map based on the Normandy landings.

I love both of these games to death, but the similarities are few and far between. Obviously source has better graphics, but the maps and communities are nearly polar opposites. \n\nDay of Defeat is much harder than its Source counterpart. Mainly because of the source engine itself. DoD has a very weird sense of physics. So weird in fact, it's hard to explain. Your weapons are widely inaccurate when you're moving in nearly any form (which is expected) but the time it takes to stop moving is hard to get used to. Jumping feels right, sprinting feels good, but they're both limited by a short energy bar. I have no problem with this whatsoever- it makes sense to me that they'd put a lot of realism into that. \n\nThe gunplay is, for lack of a better word, nice. The guns aren't pretty by any stretch, but this is an old game, stop complaining about it. They aren't hard to handle like Counter Strike, but they feel real. Killing an enemy takes a lot of effort, but gunfights are ended quickly because of how damn powerful your weapons are. In a military shooter like this one, that feeling is essential. I don't wanna feel like I'm walking around weilding nothing more powerful than a squirt gun with hot sauce in it.\n\nThe popularity of this game has sparadically decreased since its release, but thats expected. Whereas most people have moved on to Source, there's still very much a community that thrives here. Most of them for the nostalgia, but a good part of them have joined because they're looking for something new. Veterans here are very common (not war veterans, guys.) and you could tell that this was a piece of their childhood. I'm being serious. Some of these guys joined steam way back when it was made. Are they good at the game? Oh my god. I'm lucky that I walked out of spawn sometimes.\n\nWhat's my personal verdict?\nI feel like this is a relic. Something everybody should experience at some point in time. That's not that ridiculous- especially considering this game is so cheap off-sale anyway. It's hard to get the hang of, but damn do you ever feel good afterwards. Sadly, though, at the end of the day I do prefer the Source version.

Day of Defeat: Source first, but having played this game more than that, I thought I'd spit out my thoughts on this one first.\nSo, for a regular 21st century gamer for me, who plays the newer games like CS:GO, GTA V and Rocket League (which have good graphics arguably), will soon find this game unbearable for our eyes. It looks horrible on todays standards, and I could not recommend this game for anyone that doesn't want to get a huge breath of old dusty air on their faces. Playing this game is like getting a 200 years old book thrown at you.\nHowever, not everything about this game is bad. The community is still fairly large, meaning that you can most likely maybe possibly find a server with human beings in it. This is mostly because of the 30 to 40 year-old dads who play this game because they used to back when we were small and still playing at the sandbox.\nPlease, if you have gotten this far, don't take this review personal. This is my view on the game, that probably once was a great WW-game. The Source version just happens to be better. I don't really like the Source version too much either, but at least it has a huge lot better graphics than this one.\nHowever, don't get scared. If you like old stuff, you've found it.

It is really old, but has surprisingly good amount of players. All of which are old guys who probably bought the game when it came out. I feel a bit left out when playing, but it is really fun to play. \n\nPlaying in multiplayer is so fun thing to do. Time goes so fast when playing this.
